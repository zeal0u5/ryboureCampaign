First seen in [[Session 4]] when the [[three figures from the depths]] was chasing [[Luzo]] and they shot him with the poisoned arrow

the poison was removed by [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] grip the arrow with one hand and heals with the other licking around the room. Feel the corruption and the flames spread through the flames and burst with darker red/orange flame and the arrow pulls the [[corruption or poison from Luzo]] out of the veins. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Take a sample.Â </mark>

The group now has a sample and asked [[Archie]] if he knows anyone who knows poison and he put a word out for us to the [[underground poison man]] who has not been met yet. This happened in [[Session 7]]

This poison is very illegal and dangerous.

In [[Session 9]] we met with [[underground poison man]] and he said that he does not want to be caught up
Certain powerful people in the city will create their own kind of brews and it depends on what you want to do but this is not something youb can just buy, this is a small batch of a specific purpose. I suggest you forget anything that happened with this. Shit runs deep. People who look under the hood often they'll tend to disappear. Probably half of what was made. You want my guess probably [[Crims]] whatever you are fucking with you are dealing with people with money and people who wanted someone dead. 

Based off of him and the information unsure of connection with the [[Crims]]. Whomever made this had a backing. If someone would spend this much time, they won't stop trying to kill it. 

He pockets the vial. And walk away

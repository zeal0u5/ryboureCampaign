It is with very strong conjuration magic. Sold by [[Ricky]] at [[Mooncrest traveling Curio stand and entertainment venue]] for 75gp. Was found under the cart and was not a part of the venue. It was under ground. Just so happened to be there.

[[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] tried to indentify it and all he is getting is feelings and the idea that he needs to keep it on him
Then he gave it to [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] to cast Identify on and the ruby told him not to do that for 8 hours. it said "you know you should probably let this be, tell your friend that i cant cast the spell"

This is a crytaline devil that has transformed into a ruby.
- They like to stay in gemstones because they want to convince omeone to taint their own stone, for when they die they can claim their soul. If they transformed, they either kill you and cant claim the stone or you kill it and it gets sent back. 
- it is from the 6th circle of hell. Malbolge. glasya rules this level
- it takes persistance to turn a soul. 
- lesser fiend
- it is higher in the lesser heirarchy.

This ruby is trying to taint [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]'s souls by killing each other. This happened in [[Session 13]]. He does it by talking into their minds and telling them to do something. They must suceed on a wisdom save in order to not do the command. 

The ruby was put into a lead box in [[Sherry and Serin's Apartment]] in order to stop him from tempting people to kill other people. He is now on a book shelf behind some books.

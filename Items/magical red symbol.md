After fighting [[figure with sigil from session 2]] the [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] noticed a mark on the back of his neck, [[Nahran Umbra]], [[Lizee]], and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]. [[Session 2]]

Before fighting [[clarity creepy figure session 6]] [[Nahran Umbra]] felt a burning sensation on the back of his neck and noticed the figure before the fight. 
After the fight the symbol was gone from his neck. [[Session 6]]

The group first goes to [[conservatorium arcanum mail room]] to try to find a place to figure out what it means.
Then the group goes to the [[conservatorium arcanum library]] to look at books, then [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] leads the group to the [[rune database]] where we find that it is a Divination rune, can be cast rather quickly, while it cannot cast anything on its one, useful on the scry spell. [[Session 7]]

We believe that [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] put these marks on us to track us. We think that it might have something to do with hemomancy.

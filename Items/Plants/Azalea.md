[Azalea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azalea) (Rhododendron of the heath family [Ericaceae])

-   They bloom in the spring (April and May in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, and October and November in the Southern Hemisphere)
-   They prefer to be in the shade and the flowers last several weeks.
-   They are slow growing and do not need fertilizer, (leave it alone and it will thrive)
-   Azaleas and rhododendrons were once so infamous for their toxicity that to receive a bouquet of their flowers in a black vase was a well-known death threat.
-   When bees harvest the pollen/sap they make “mad honey” which is “mind-altering” and potentially medicinal

This is a fancy inkwell and pen that [[Morana Vosnesensky]] found in the mimic room in [[Session 22]]. It had draconic writing on it that says Acher Neverrealm. [[Nahran Umbra]] took it from Morana for [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] to translate. Nahran keeps the pen and ink for himself. 

He is going to use it during the next long rest to write his frustrations about morana out and then give the pen back to her. He is writing this in the ink of the pen he took (in full vision of anyone). He is also going to draw everyone in the caligraphy style with this pen.

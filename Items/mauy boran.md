[[Ryo Enlana]] gave the Mauy Boran (Muay Thai Ropes) to [[Nahran Umbra]] at the [[Lathanders Light Monestary]] because he felt a disturbance in the force. 

These wraps hold 3 charges. Once on your turn, you may expend 1 charge to add 1d6 force damage to a successful unarmed strike. You heal for the extra damage dealt. The gloves regain 1 charge for every 10 minutes of contemplative meditation. This meditation will only regain charges once per day and if interrupted, cannot be attempted until the next day.

In [[Session 7]] [[Havoc]] found this book
It is yellow cover and has gold gilded on the edges of the pages, when opened there seems to be no writing on the pages.
[[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] is especially interested in this book

In [[Session 9]] Serin looks down on the return trip and feels something in his hand look down and sees corruption all the way up to his elbow.
As he touches the ring he feels searing pain as almost a small shape starts to form and the book appears on/in his arm.


In [[Session 12]], [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] goes into a private section of the [[conservatorium arcanum library]] with the pull. Almost like a pinprick pressence
See the bookand he feels like he needs to take it
Serin touches it. vibe: unsure not familiar, feel a deep twinge of hate. it isbehind a locked bookshelf
[[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] lock picks the book case bar so that serin could have the book.
Later, serin looks at the [[yellow gilded book]] feels something inside of you to want to wipe it out of existance
- serin flips through the pages they are all blank
- serin just sits

[[Session 16]]
- home alone at the [[Sherry and Serin's Apartment]] one day, pages are still blank, it is dark outside, alone, open it up and for a moment see text flicker on the page and the lights kind of flicker off. and it gets quicker until its a blinding strobe and everything goes dark
- it is no longer the same book, it is a dark tome with dripping tendrils covering the back with teel and fangs curling up the sides like a clasp, the center to the book is one eye staring at him. Everything else around him is darkness. The eye goes pitch black and then you see a ripple like water in the eye before suddenly a hand shoots out and grabs the side and starts pulling itself out of the void within the book. He tries to close it and his hands wont move. All  he can do is watch. He sees it but does not understand what he sees
	- it is a complexity so beyond his understanding that to be able to grasp the idea of this would be more information that he could p\ossibly learn in his entire lifetime. For a split second he sees a vaster experiance imagine imagining. And then as he looks up he feels a dread take over. before everything snaps back to normal. The dread is not from seeing what you saw its from knowing now you cant understand what that memory was. It is almost blocked. He knows it happened but it is just unthinkable.
	- For a moment, you feel something in your mind, its a shift like you are comfortable now, but you realize you have never been in your entire life. He suddenly becomes very ill. and then he spends the rest of the night throwing up, violently.

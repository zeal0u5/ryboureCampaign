These are the pens [[Nahran Umbra]] bought at the [[full moon festival of kyre]]. He gave one to [[Mythdran Cauldic]] <3 so that they can write letters to each other with secret ink. They are magically enchanted pens that write invisible then turn visible when hit with the pen set. 


Also during the long rest in the session after [[Session 22]] he is going to cronicle the happenings of the mine to write to [[Mythdran Cauldic]] and tell him about it later.

[[Session 21]] [[Session 23]] [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]

in [[Session 21]] 
- serin runs to the rocks they are kind of buzzing in grey heap - serin has heard of them - there are creatures that come from different planes and when they die they will most likely will not stay in this dimension
- they are starting to fade away 
- serin wants so many of them - he puts 20 rocks in page as he opens the book - everything in his mind goes blank and black hears "i can tether these to the plane for you" he feels something but not sure what 

they are from something we killed 
- there are a pile of the triangles in the center and it rockets and sticks to the pile
- they start to form and multiply and trickle as a mass of the tiny triangles


in [[Session 23]]
serin after three hours of a watch - he opens his book and grabs one of the little triangle rocks - they are not anchered within space or time - it has some bearing but you feel as if the way it experiences the material plane is fuzzy could hold potential for something - maybe a hive mind maybe thats what made up its body. he knows its foreign. when holding two there is a slight pull for them to be together. no point in which they snap together

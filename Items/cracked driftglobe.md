It produces 20ft of dim light. It was originally collected in [[Session 2]] after the [[figure with sigil from session 2]] was teleported away in the same room as the crates. [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] originally had it then gave it to [[Nahran Umbra]]. In [[Session 9]] it was given to [[Lizee (in jail)]] to expore in the [[The Sewers]]. While exploring everyone was sucked into the [[omonous cozy room with darkness]]. It floats above the ground. This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word cause it to emanate the [Light](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:light) spell. "cactus"

[[Lizee (in jail)]] asked for it in [[Session 9]] and then [[Nahran Umbra]] gets it back and uses it at [[437 south rutherford lane]] to light up the room while talking to [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]].

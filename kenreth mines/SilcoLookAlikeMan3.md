tall human man slick back hair wearing nice fitted similar to what people wear for ceremonies with the vibe of a formal robe like a body suit and he has a face - older (late 50s) pointy beard 

Found in Kenreth Mines with [[BirdCloakMan2]] and [[GeoHeavyArmorMan1]] on level 7 ish in the mines after fighting mimics in [[Session 22]].

"ughhh, so good to finally meet you, a minute of your time for conversation"

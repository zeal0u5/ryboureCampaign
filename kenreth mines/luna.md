This is a wizard studying gravity abnormailities and the arcane weave in the [[kenrith mining company]] mine in [[Session 20]]. She was a figure standing towards the wall with a sack against the wall with little bobbles from it and stuff sticking out from the pockets, steriotypical wizard garb. She has dark brown hair, glasses at edge of nose. She has a "familiar" cat named [[marbles]]. She controlled dark purple energy that changes gravity and asked [[Nahran Umbra]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Morana Vosnesensky]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]. to tell her if we notice any weird gravity changes.

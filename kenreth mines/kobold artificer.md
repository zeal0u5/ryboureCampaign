This is the kobold from [[Session 20]]. He gave [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] the blueprint trap for the slug jar thing during the corpse fight on level 2. The slug jar is thrown with a metal cage and it falls with slug and it bursts into electric pulse. He is a small scaly creature with a backpack with contraptions on it. He has a small crude looking four legged creature made from clockwork start walking in a circle.

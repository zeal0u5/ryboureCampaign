The group goes here in [[Session 6]] to try to get the protoype back from [[Ritsko]]. It opens into a room like [[orênge workshop]] and then into a testing room with a lot of trinkets and toys. 

Large building of opalescent grey, without seams on the house, very well crafted. No windows, but it has porthole mouths. Pipes go in and out the building. 2 stories but a domed roof on the 3rd story. Does not fit with any architecture, corners are curved, and the door is curved.

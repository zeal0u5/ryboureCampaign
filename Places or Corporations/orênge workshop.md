This was first seen in [[Session 5]], [[orÃªnge]] lives here and [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] went there to learn transmutation for a little boat. Similar to [[Ritsko workshop]]. 

Building is two stories up and further is lost to a haze, big iron door within the stone and metal building

Door opens into a dark room and the door slams behind them and the room flares to light, small tiles and beams on the ceiling, small chamber and another door. 2 benches built into the wall, nothing in the middle

inside the room, door slams, huge projects, equipment, pipes converge in and go many directions, very steampunk

One day, the door is uncharacteristicly bolted and locked shut. It seems weirdly cold. He left in a rush one day. [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]]  asks around, they say that the place has been locked up since early this morning and they haven't seen any sight of them. Some say that he entered the town suddenly. He usually lets someone know if he is going to leave. one helpful person: they saw him last night and he looked a little frazzled but the wrong way

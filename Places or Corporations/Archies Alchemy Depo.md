This is run by [[Archie]]. It is an alchemy shop that has been around for forever. It was ransacked before [[Session 1]] because a group of robbers stole crates from the store, things got knocked over and glass was broken. Everything seemed to be fixed by [[Session 4]] and it seems as though nothing had happened by [[Session 7]]. On the left is [[Miechaelâ€™s]] hostel and tavern.

This place is frequented by [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Lizee]], and [[Nahran Umbra]] for supplies and moonshine.

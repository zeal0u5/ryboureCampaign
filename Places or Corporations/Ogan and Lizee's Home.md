This is in the [[kessigs expance]] of the city. It is to the south of the city and is centered within a forest. [[Lizee (in jail)]] lives in a shack with her [[Raccoons (in jail)]]. [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] lives in a tree next to lizee's shack. Nahran also has a little home made out of trees on the ground next to the two of them as well. The forest seems to be doing well, there are no diseases it seems. [[Luzo]] also stays here now in a tree as well while he is regaining his strength.

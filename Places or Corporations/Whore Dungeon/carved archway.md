First appears in the [[]] mountains that were authorized by the [[kessigs expance]]. While on a quest to get [[Pernalious]] stuff back. It was carved into the mountain and the group ignored it and kept walking. 

When passing it on the way back We hear a loud pop and the stone is completely flush. It disappears.

After talking to [[underground poison man]] in [[The Sewers]] there was a sound that [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] [[Nahran Umbra]] heard and they ignored it. [[Lizee (in jail)]] stealth to check to see what's happening with the orb i gave him. Lizee stays close to the wall and something shifts. As she looks to the side a curved indent in the stone like an arch. 

Lizee pushes it and hears a grinding, and it slides itself in and is in pitch darkness.She feels a pull in the arch. And tries to hold on. with just the fingertips outside the door. [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] fully is sucked into the door. 

The three of us left go and investigate and I get sucked in. Then [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] and serin jump in with us. 
Ogan and the Lizee wake up and feel warmth coming from behind them. Warmly lit room with shadows and shapes of a fire dancing. Wooden floor boards. Stand up and look around. Ceiling is a pitch black abyss of nothingness. Incedibly out of place door made of light stone and it has an incredibly inlit and copper inlay like a cathedral. Pulled into [[omonous cozy room with darkness]]

In [[Session 10]] the group leaves from the [[Interdimensional Whore's Dungeon]] made by [[whore head]] to get back into [[The Sewers]].

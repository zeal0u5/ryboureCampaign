[[Ogan the Flame Shell]] and the [[Lizee]] wake up and feel warmth coming from behind them. Warmly lit room with shadows and shapes of a fire dancing. Wooden floor boards. Stand up and look around. Ceiling is a pitch black abyss of nothingness. Incedibly out of place door made of light stone and it has an incredibly inlit and copper inlay like a cathedral. Pulled into [[omonous cozy room with darkness]]. [[Nahran Umbra]] [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] wake up after them and fall from the nothingness.

From the [[carved archway]]. 

This was the first room to the [[Interdimensional Whore's Dungeon]] made by [[whore head]].

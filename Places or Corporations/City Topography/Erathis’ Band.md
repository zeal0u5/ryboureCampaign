The middle ring, Erathis’ Band, is made up of a majority of the population, spreading from the edge of the farmland to the barrier of the thin [[Gilded Strip]]. Containing all walks of life completing all sorts of jobs, if it can be found in the hustle of a city, it can be found in the Erathis’ Band. Unlike the [[Kessig's Tend]], Erathis’ band is set on rocky terrain, covered in winding streets, closely packed buildings, and many tunnels and cave openings, both used and forgotten. Its sewer system interlocks and shares many tunnels with the vast cavern system sitting under [[Ryboure]].

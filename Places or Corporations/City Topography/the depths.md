This is where the group explored and found [[Mythdran Cauldic]], [[Regis]], [[Luzo]], [[three figures from the depths]], [[lush room]], [[slime room ew]], [[dark shadowy figure session 3]]. It is under the city centered in the middle. Almost always dark. It holds many neighboorhoods and different types of planta and magic within it. 

The Depths encompass the massive, circular opening running down into the ground, as well as the craggy ravine that cuts through all three bands on the north side of the city. Entrances to the depths can come from [[The Opening]], the mile-wide hole in the ground, [[The Krag]], a dangerous ravine on the northernmost point of the city, or any number of various tunnels, cave openings, and passageways from the [[Gilded Strip]] or [[Erathis’ Band]]. The Depths are inhabited by many races of those who prefer to stay away from sunlight, many working under providence of the various mining companies, or those looking to get away from the city, whether that be for solitude, to escape the reach of [[the assembly]], or any other reason. Many who live in The Depths must be ready to protect or hide themselves at a moment’s notice, as a wide array of creatures, beasts, abominations, and other monsters live deeper within The Depths. They have been known to occasionally wander higher up towards the city, but it usually doesn’t pose a threat to the surface.

The outermost ring, The Kessig’s Tend, is the largest in area, nearly twice the size of the other two rings combined. Producing most of the food and natural resources for the city, the residents take advantage of both the fertile [[kessigs expance]] as well as druidic magics to sustain the city’s massive population. Bordering the wide, grassy plains of the Kessig Expanse, residents have had encounters with bandits and rovers, as well as the occasional wandering beast, but both [[Hands of the Regent]] and privately hired adventurers make sure to keep the lands safe for the residents.

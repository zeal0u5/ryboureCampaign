This si the room the group encountered in [[Session 3]] in [[the depths]].

Once entered the group looked around the room [[Nahran Umbra]] collected [[dragonâ€™s beard moss]]. [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] did something, and [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] touched the statue after a while. Then vines blocked the entance and exit to the room. Finally Ogan teleported the three of us out and towards the other two, then we ran throught the room and teleported again. 

The solve to the riddle of the room was if you did not believe the vines were real they would disappear.

It is the next morning
Go to the [[conservatorium arcanum]] (2hr walk) 

Sprawling campus, tons of different buildings, one tower, intricate elven architecture, spreading in a wide arc
-   Most of the people are walking with a purpose
-   Crisp morning fading into the body of autumn
-   I am going try to find [[Mythdran Cauldic]]
    

It takes me a little bit to find the address that mithdrin sent from
-   Smallish building, wooden, unassuming, wave of heat. Large fireplace over to the side, small counter, rows of small wooden boxes
-   Room is empty, front room
-   Serin rings the bell, somewhat older dwarf woman with scruff 
-   Its the [[conservatorium arcanum mail room]]
    


Try to get to the [[conservatorium arcanum library]], takes a bit to get there, midday get there

Slate building with double doors, big winding staircase, massive balconies, see up to the third floor, giant bookshelves

To the side there looks to be a help desk, in the chair there is a black and white feathered individual
-   Very quiet in here
-   We ask to see the books, they ask for a student id
-   They leave to talk to someone
-   Lizee sends the racoons to look for the magical books
-   Me and four guests can stay but we cant take anything out
-   I show the avian the [[magical red symbol]]
    

We have the other person with black hair look for some books they go and look for the books
She pulls, 20 books on symbols 
7 is common
6 Are elven
2 cylestial/infernal
2 in sylvan
3 in dwarven

Lizee various types of infernal symbols, for contracts and sealing documents
Dwarven runes carved into stone, stationary runes, enchanting or carved deal with protection types and culturally steep tradition
Not much on runes put onto people, any runes like this would take time
Sylvan, systematic, fey in nature, used for whatever the person sees fit, very personal, or jokes. hard to decipher a rune.

Elven, get through 3 books, abjuration put on many things, more intriqute, not really it, another book on process of removing runes, magical, scratch, or go through a process, depending of the thing that put it on us, evolution of wards and runes that are placed upon buildings

Lizee receives five books from five racoons

-   [[Calamity]]: book about history from 2nd to 5th era types of steel and tempering from dwarvish people, also armor stuff
-   [[Armageddon]], brings back a notebook
-   [[Devastation]]: different types of schematics for trebuchet and technical diagrams, patten design
-   [[Havoc]], yellow, faded, no text on the front or back, pages are gilded 
	-   Open it up, pages seems to be blank
	- [[yellow gilded book]]
-   [[Chongles]], leather dark bound, frayed at the edges, almost like bone, front: eye made into the leather, book has a lock 
	- [[leather bound eye book]]
    
Common: 2 aren’t useful, set up books around, im systematically conspiracy board lookin
-   Symbols that go on peoples bodies for long periods of time
-   Symbol will last as long as it is useful, on a person it will stay until it doesn’t serve a purpose, when removed the purpose will not function, when it is not needed, it will remove itself,
-  Various types of symbols for differing amounts of time. For long time, it will take a long time long time could be days-months-years, 
-   I pick out 4 types of symbols that are generally long lasting
	-   1 curse and gives them a terminal disease, magically siphon life force, 
	-   2 generally not used on people, but used on very powerful things, bind them in one spot
	-   3 powerful, almost like a promise, used a lot in war times for alliances or specific circumstances, if either break it and it will have a negative affect
	-   4 rune that is not as high of power, but its not an affect by itself, it can be used in conjunction with differing types of divination magic, to gain information, when they get more powerful they can become trackers
    
The person lizee is talking to about the eye book, the person is switching cadence and tonal stuff, and they take the book from them, “would you like me to find something with pictures in it?” important locations within the city, thick book, intricate pictures, “this is boring” sick ass weapons in the second book

We are able to find someone, older gnomish gentleman, well kept beard, glasses, talking to a much taller, wait for the woman to walk off woman = [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]]

-   We explain what information we want.
-   Looks around a massive piece of parchment, 10ft by 20ft
-   Hemocraft, blood magic. 
-   Not very researched, many people have used it before, but they wouldn’t have any information
-   If this rune exists in an established spelled it will be in a [[rune database]] that will take a while to go through
-   [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]]
	-   “Get all the eyes you can”
    
-   Serin goes to get the friends
-   Lizee is trying to send the racoons to get the [[leather bound eye book]]
-   They go out and a [[woman with flaming hair]] find them and scream, the racoons are floating in the air
-   She lets them go and lizee runs away
-   They come to the woman with serin, follow me
-   We go down to the first floor near the back of the library
-   Matches the architecture, but a little out of place, go to the basement
-   More the small lights floating around, but it is rather dim here, one large room, not as big as the library
-   Center of the room, touches bookshelf, opens to a series of books with similar spines, 
-   As far as I know, i cant get a great read, she seems important, i can tell she is not one to be obvious in her emotions
-   Turns and briskly walk away
-   We start at the [[rune database]], 1 hr later,
-   Serin finds a very similar looking symbol, with a little information
-   Sherry hear the bag start to shake a bit, some of the bookshelves are rattling, stops when glass shatters ([[vials of blood]])
	-   Divination rune, can be cast rather quickly, while it cannot cast anything on its one, useful on the scry spell
-   The bag is seeping with red from inside, around the room is blood oozing down, under the table is pooling up a bit
-   When we reach that point in the book as the table is broken in two, blood coalesce into a figure in the center of the room serin and I are covered in blood
-   FIGURE: 12ft tall, completely covering the table, enveloping us, dripping horns, [[amorphous blood monster]] teeth and eyes, dripping

Serin cleans with prestidigitation 20-30 minutes
The books are safe
The [[magical red symbol]] did not change on the necks

The symbol is only on the three of them (lizee, ogan, sherry)
They try to drag me out, i refuse, then give in
We tell the front desk person what happened

We walk away right as we walk out: lizee is frozen in place with loud alarms, “where’s the book” the libraries take the book ([[leather bound eye book]])

Nahran is distraught and goes to the plant place and serin follows
Everyone else goes to [[Archie]]’s

[[Archies Alchemy Depo]]:

-   Back on his feet after the stuff was stolen
-   Talks to [[Archie]], any updates with the sample, i can get the message to him if they want [[underground poison man]]
    

Head back: 

[[Luzo]] fluttering around, squawk
Lizee goes into the shack
Vibe check on forest, doing alright

[[conservatorium arcanum Green House]]:
-   Intricate elven and human architecture, scopes and spirals up the building that he lecture hall is in
-   Not very many of each strain or species, but very pretty some i know about, but much of them are magically changed, amalgamation of experiments
-   I take a few steps out of the greenhouse and a figure approaches us, 
-   [[goliath student guide]] Large half giant with chain around their neck, leather tunic, large black boots, book under their arm

-   “Sent to get you to one of the administration buildings”

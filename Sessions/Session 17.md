[[Raccoons]] [[Armageddon]], [[Devastation]], [[Chongles]], [[Havoc]], [[Calamity]].

17th of Dra'in (afternoon)
We have left the [[Church of Erathis]]. 

I go to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] to give [[Archie]] the vials of water to try to identify the poison in the water. 
Stake out the well in front of the [[blanch family]] house. In the cobble roads. Most buildings are 3 stories high. 
- [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] knocks on the old lady's door to try to stay at her house.
	- [[Lizee]] cones later to ask about the roof and there are stairs up
	- [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] picks the lock to get up the stairs
	- there is a window at the top of the stairway
	- [[Nahran Umbra]] climbs up the building and makes it to the roof
	- Lizee knocks on the person on the third floor's door
		- convinces him to let them inside to "inspect the windows"
			- he is an old short man with a tweed vest. 
		- roof is about 5 feet up and it hangs out at about a foot
		- lizee tries to get onto the window
		- nahran puts the rope down to her and lizee grabs on. I hold on with my astral arms to carry lizee up. I become an anchor point. 
			- Lizee fucking fails and slides down and falls
			- I continue to be an anchor point to get other people up
			- serin gets on the roof
	- Ogan asks the old lady to stake out the well in her house
		- he casts speak with animals
			- surrounded by voices and sounds
			- [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] sends a mental message to ogan to check up on him
			- cat snake pit from the lego movie
	- Lizee and sherry are still on the floor
		- serin asks sherry if they can find a way up
		- sherry failed to jump up 15 feet
		- we try to hold the rope to get sherry up to the roof, sherry slides down again
	- lizee acts drunk in front of the well

#### Waiting
- people are passing by, it becomes the 18th of dra'in. 
- the ogan talks to the cats
- serin takes the first shift asleep and completes it and I'll take the second one as a short rest
- Serin sees it first
	- an individual walking alone, intently, and doesn't seem to be coming from a fun night out
		- they notice lizee
	- 5 minutes later... 10 minutes later... then they walk up towards the well and look to see if lizee is asleep and they continue what they are doing
		- pull out something long and unfold it.
		- what they are doing is very obscured
		- then they walk up 10 feet 
		- I slide down the side of the building and then they see me
	- Lizee tries to thornwhip him back as he runs and succeeds 6 damage
	- unknown man squeezes a pouch and white fumes overtake lizee and she sleeps

**

Crisp fall morning, not quite cold yet, summer is quickly fading into a more autumnal feel. 
I am in a hustle, the two are in their tree house and the others are work, life thing
Job board:
-   Job posted by [[golden grace tavern]], spooky happenings
-   Job from [[drigan neighborhood]] representative, [[Brar Venhart]] assistance with recent increase in muggings and crime
	-   Assemblies: 5 districts, each have 11 assembly seats, governance is up to the district. [[Lower bralumn]]. (south east [pretty far])
    
[[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] sees [[Nahran Umbra]] walking and i try to convince them im fine, does not work at all
Homeless man on the street: [[jean]], used to be a painter

We go to get food:
[[Ogan the Flame Shell]] and lizee go to [[Archie]]’s with alcohol. Loud. Tries to sell medical grade alcohol. I know someone who might buy a bottle I guess. [[The breaker]] is an alcoholic.

Eating in [[Miechael’s]] and lizee barges in. 

[[jean]] came from a smaller town called [[belrith]], 2 weeks south west of here, not the closest town, but a notable one. Grew up in the city his father was a painter, never knew his mother. 

You need a liquor license to sell alcohol, lizee is now going to try to get one at the district license.

Arrive at the [[community hall]]. With a bulletin board. Not updated regularly

Human mid 30’s bob hair, at desk in office. They go through the paperwork, [[Lizee]]’s name is canonically LIZEE LIZEE, 2 days

Make a stand with trees and have [[jean]] sell stuff. Ogan gives him some pigment from the forest

We decide to do the sketchy job (4hrs):

Northern end of the city, order to the craig, on the western side, get there by mid afternoon

-   Unassuming building, same as al the others in line with it. Metal stone and wood, basic dwarven architecture. No signs or embellishments. Not well traveled. A lot of industry, not really for rich people. 
-   Lizee knocks x2
-   Door opens and see: not an individual expected. Figure 6 ft tall dark red skin, wearing very lavish purple/red robe. Silk. 2 horns on the side of their head, embellished with jewelry, slippers, notice small cross body leather something.
-   Walk in: intricate wall paper, lavish full length rugs, framed art, beautiful crafted full set of elven carved furniture, chandelier red light, 
-   one painting above the mantle: painting of famous city throughout history: gnath’shaarat. Infernal name. City long ago that was inhabited by tieflings during one of the wars of antiquity, destroyed, ruin are eroded underground. Lost to time. From things that survive, this is that city.
-   “[[Martin]]” hobbling in figure short, stocky, goblin. 
-   The job: sign an NDA. I imported some fine luxury goods, heavily regulated commodities. (either illegal goods or things with cultural significance artifacts) got into a little spat with the individuals who were shipping it and they left it somewhere in the mountains, went to the locations and then got the goods and brought it back. 600 gold total. Extending a hand, the raccoon shakes. 
-   Wine, spies and very important art sculpture, awfully small, more like a curio
-   Tea comes out with [[martin]], rich people shit. [[Martin]] is not speaking, but using hand gestures
	-   Kind of a basis of sign language, influenced by each language, common base. Depending on the language sign language looks different. 
-   Location: due south, follow the path after the bend go to the left a bit. Right now we are in [[tiffond]]
-   Under jurisdiction of [[kessigs expance]]. Not enough people live there. Port is run by [[the regency]]. Used for priority government shipping and people who have the money to pay for it. And it is a waystation
    
-   Their name is [[Pernalious]].
    

We stay as north as possible: the next morning

-   I ready rope dart, lizee sword, sherry flamethrower
-   Heavy impact and 2 holes in the wall higher up, massive cockroach beasts  head towards the group, not making aggressive movements yet

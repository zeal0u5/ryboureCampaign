it is 3 am, 14th of Lonin, light clouds
We are in the cool mickey mouse club house of expiramentation. ([[personal study and basement]])
[[exanguinator]] [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] knife is identified as a magical dagger - nate will send to me
As we walk out we see two bright lights pointed directly at us, the owl is still following the directions. [[barnabey]] is still doing what he was told. He flies and lands on [[Ogan the Flame Shell]]. 
[[Nahran Umbra]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], [[Lizee (in jail)]], and [[Raccoons (in jail)]] go to the inn.
We take a long rest at the inn. 
I take the murder board down. 
Someone knocks. : young human teenager and hands us a small pouch and leaves.
- smaller coin purse and a note and a hardy peice of parchment
- ogan hands the readables to me
	- from [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] "while this does not completely absolve my debt to you it is a token of my debt to you"
	- the parchment grants us the resources of [[conservatorium arcanum]].
	- 500 gold peices

I write [[Letter 4 to Myth]] and go to [[conservatorium arcanum mail room]] to give the letter to [[Mythdran Cauldic]]. The I go to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] and get supplies for 2 healing potions. 
[[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] go home. As they walk in: The family asks them to pay for rent so that they can hire new people. 
- they are going to either pay rent or find a new place to stay
- Sherry looks at the [[ruby]]. 
	- serin makes a wis save while handing the rock over "how dare they disrespect you, kill them, murder them"
	- sherry tries to identify the ruby its not making sense, there is magic and she can tell what it is, almost if it reacts when sherry almost figures it out and changes
	- serin tells sherry about the talking
	- sherry hears "kill!" to the best of her ability she must follow the command for te next action
		- Sherry does firebolt and misses
	- Sherry mends the curtain
- the rock told to kill
- Sherry casts identify again
	- it is a magical gemstone worth 500 gp, it cannot be destroyed, it is currently a crytaline devil in the form of a ruby, it is sentient and it can turn back into a devil at any time. it can see its surroundings
- they decide that they need to get rid of it. 
- "your wills will bend eventually"
- "i could slaughter you right now"

sherry puts the ruby in the corner and then whispers to serin to try to plan what to do with it.
Devils have a hierarchy in the 9 hells, if they die, (the only way to kill it is in the abyss), in the over world, their sould is sent back and the devil is demoted almost. 
It does have the abilities to magically sway people
They are gonna take it to go to the [[conservatorium arcanum library]] to try to learn about it

Ogan and lizee head back to the [[The tempered flame]] 
- there are a few other people there wearing differing styles of stuff, with differing weapons.
	- they are discussing the whereabouts of certain people
	- they are not government sanctioned people
- [[fire genasi worker]] is working on shit in the forge. 
	- he examines the roach plates and looks at it
	- lizee lets him buy it for 100 gp

They go to [[jean]] hes doing pretty well
gives lizee 4 gp and 2 silver

they go to [[Ogan and Lizee's Home]]. They get home at mid afternoon
ogan makes a healing potion. 

[[Archie]] says to me: if you are looking to return the favor from [[underground poison man]]. theres some ingredients he needds that are awfully rare, you have to forge for them. in the [[kessigs expance]] it will be south east in the hill area, there are a few caves and burrows and there's a big centaur but if the bottom half was a scorpion. they are pretty dangerous, but if you get some bits from them. their venom and a few mandables and any other bits and peices. 
just let me know when youre bringing them back.
I would know that the stuff that archie is talking about that it is some variant of the scorpio drider. they are a thing that exists. 

I want to go to the [[conservatorium arcanum library]]. to research what [[Mythdran Cauldic]] is into. I get a basic understanding. I know the plant side, but not the magic. I able to leave with a better understanding about it. Not a ton of literature. 

I try to look for stuff about my parents, i don't find anything additional.

I go to [[prof lillia vreth]]'s office. There's no one in the lecture hall. I go to her door. she has a maternal feel. I head home for the night. 

HOUSE HUNTERS!
They split up to look for job postings. 
- Whatever they are looking for they can find.
- They want to rent somewhere
1. flowy archetecture, it is like an attic room, polished. various outcoves, plenty of space. two rooms one bedroom with two beds and various other outsoves. and a small kitchenette and a table. It comes with the beds but not the rest. (second floor for rent). Very close to the [[conservatorium arcanum]]
2. sturdy almost dwarven stone building. it is built directly into a cave. the second floor is built into the cave wall. It is a bit cooler, more space, three rooms. 1. proper kitchen/dining room 2. bedroom with two beds. 3. huge room empty. very good craftsmanship and stone work. above a store and they own a mining supplies store. closest to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]]
3. it is the smallest square footage, almost semi circle building. the person that occupies the first two floors is not forthright named [[dwuv scrantalious]]. old knome with long beard. third floor for rent. spiral staircase. with a very tall loft. no furnishings. closest to the pipes. 

They agree with the 1 aka [[farehaven and serin apt]]. They need to show 6 months of rent (60 gold). They look over the [[apartment lease]]. 

i research about fam and potions: 
- githzerai and githyanki came from gith who were enslaved by mind flayers
- they come from plane of limbo, which is pure chaos. beyond the astral sea and plane.
- after revolution they kindof moved around I would know that I came from limbo. I cant find anything on my specific peoples
- bits and peices from a collection of a bunch of different books

serin researches crystaline devils:
- They like to stay in gemstones because they want to convince omeone to taint their own stone, for when they die they can claim their soul. If they transformed, they either kill you and cant claim the stone or you kill it and it gets sent back. 
- it is from the 6th circle of hell. Malbolge. glasya rules this level
- it takes persistance to turn a soul. 
- lesser fiend
- it is higher in the lesser heirarchy.

Serin and Sherry furnish the apartment: 21 gold
- three chairs 
- two desks
- dragon chess set

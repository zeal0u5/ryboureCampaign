### from [[Session 20]]  21st Dra'in

### Going to level 4
- wake up well rested all things considered
- no changes to the environment
- i grab a rat tooth for proof
- around the hallway order: morana, nahran, ogan, sherry, serin
- spiral staircase down for 20 steps before it ends, look down and there is a drop (10 foot) - stone ground
- morana jumps down and tries to tuck and roll
	- see around you there are 4 diagonal walls and spaces going forward
- i jump down fine
- sherry jumps down with ogan and tumbles a bit - 5 damage
- serin does it succesfully

### Level 4
- we see walls at the end of the horizontal hallways
- suprisingly barren room, doesnt look like it has purpose
- walls made from a lot of smaller stones stacked together
- ogan hits the stone wall, the wall is very solid
	- almost slowed down as he hit it
- there is nothing that stands out about these rocks
- something feels off about the rocks
- in the northwest corner there is a small triangle stone that is inlaid in the floor, morana pokes it with foot and it bounces up, she pulls it out,
	- small triangular prism it buzzing a little bit
	- dark grey purplish tint
- no triangle shaped holes, when close to the wall the wall starts to pull, it does the same thing to both walls
- ogan finishes detect magic - strong magical force behind it like a blanket not a spcecific school - closest to transmutation magic
	- stone has same feeling
- the stone sticks onto the wall and pushes it, it gives a little bit
	- pull out the hammer and it rockets through. The wall crumbles
- there are a pile of the triangles in the center and it rockets and sticks to the pile
- they start to form and multiply and trickle as a mass of the tiny triangles
- against the other wall were two metal objects that look like shart curved blades and it takes form into large insectoid creture, like a spout from torso and snout and blades for arms
- we all feel a way of nausea

#### initiative
- triangle bug: screeches and flickers and diapears and gets really close to morana (misses) and ogan (misses) - ogan with detect magic still up

- nahran i get arms out hit 2 for 14 total if feels weird and like it is matching the force i give and it is slowing down like a tampoline force
- sherry scorching ray with triangle entrance and hits all three 14 damage
- dark amorphous mass dripping down the wall and morana feels a cold wet seeping and there and uncanny dodge for 4 damage ans 5 psychic damage passes the wis throw
- triangle bug: fails save and takes 18 damage then hits nahran once and slashes me in the stomach for 13 damage attack of opportunity and it takes 8 damage

- bug - moon beam 8 damage and comes up to me and hits me twice19 slashing and 2 force and then at -10 and down to 0 and down
- ogan sees me fallen and casts 1st level healing word - arise and now i am at 6 hp and then move moon beam and steps two away from the goop and looks away

- serin - eldrige blast and hits goop 1 for 9 damage then hits goop 2 for 6

- morana throw dagger at goop 2 for 7 
- serin takes a step back and hits for 22 and it takes 15 points of cold then gets hit for 26 then eldrige blast for one at each hits both and kills both


goop covers everyone in range

serin runs to the [[triangle rocks]]
- they are kind of buzzing in grey heap - serin has heard of them - there are creatures that come from different planes and when they die they will most likely will not stay in this dimension
- they are starting to fade away 
- serin wants so many of them - he puts 20 rocks in page as he opens the book - everything in his mind goes blank and black hears "i can tether these to the plane for you" he feels something but not sure what 
- morana keeps the blades and they work as scimtar

there are sigils on the wall that are in a different language but similar syntax for keeping power where they should be, best bet is that they were here to contain the rock dude and keep it bound

sherry is going to try to keep the vials through sigils

there is one sigil that is different 

morana gets to the corner with the triangle thing and the ground feels different in a part, the texture is off and it feels hollow at the same time the sigil lights up it flashes dimly

morana insults nahran's hair, now i am ***pissed***

the one lighting up is strong with illusion magic

i destroy the sigil with my arms and then the illusion breaks and there is a hole

the ball bearning does not take long to reach

we are resting in before - used 3 hit dice and got up to 38 hp

i just go down the hole and then jump down and i see stone around me and then one opening



USED 1 ki and 1 mauy boran

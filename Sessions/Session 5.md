[[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] goes [[Sherry and Serin's Apartment]] (3 days gone)
-   Almost gets fired
    
-   [[The Sewers]] 60 years ago attempt to make cities connect with pipes that carry water steam and magic
-   There are many businesses that are there that are boarded up, active, just a variety of things
-   Invent things to get buy, or improve upon things
-   This is the industrial revolution of the city
-   Sherry wants to learn or for someone to teach them
-   People seem busy, sherry asks around, man with metal cuff and arm cover with an exoskeleton on his hand
-   Sherry walks over asks if they know about transmutation
-   “Try [[orênge]]”??? Points to brass pipe , follow this 3 blocks down one over when it splits take a left go until building with
-   Building is two stories up and further is lost to a haze, big iron door within the stone and metal building
	- [[orênge workshop]]
-   Sherry knocks, echoey, resounding, as soon as the sound stops, servos/motors go
-   Slit above door opens and a circular piece of glass can be seen
-   Sherry asks for [[orênge]] and hears clicking sound
	-   Door opens into a dark room and the door slams behind them and the room flares to light, small tiles and beams on the ceiling, small chamber and another door. 2 benches built into the wall, nothing in the middle
    
-   Calls out, hears “state your intention” , “learn cool things”
-   Short maybe 5’ dragon-born silver/ashy grey scales, wearing leather harness with tool belts, spectacles, 1 normal lens and the other lens, something protruding from the side, (little arm)
-   Very big workshop of just stuff behind him
-   Sherry goes inside the room, door slams, huge projects, equipment, pipes converge in and go many directions, very steampunk
-   He thinks he can help teach transmutation
-   Knocks everything off a table to the side and pulls a piece of metal with slightly glowing blue rune, gearbox with arm and leather
    
-   1st automatas crank robot and trigger can’t run forever, magical exhaust and heat byproducts would melt it
-   2nd powered by sherry, integrated, control with his mind, when activated it powers on, concentrate on while it is big
    
-   He got something stolen so either he wants the design back or he is going to want payment
-   [[Ritsko]] is stealing shit. Long standing rivalry, they are working on the same thing and he thinks he stole his designs
    

-   They write 4-5 runes and throws metal on it and it apparatus into sparks and leaves
-   Brass wand that is curved at the end and has gears of different sizes and it ends into a branch. They start drawing designs with the boat and it shrinks into a proportional design

### Starting/intro
[[Lizee]], [[Nahran Umbra]], [[Raccoons]], [[Calamity]], [[Armageddon]], [[Havoc]], [[Chongles]], [[Devastation]], [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]]

Exit from the [[Interdimensional Whore's Dungeon]] into [[The Sewers]]. 

Sunlight beams are shining through the buildings, coming at an angle.
We are back into the same alley.

I go to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] to get supplies for acid.
It is the 11th day of lonin in the morning.

I go to [[Lathanders Light Monestary]]. [[Lizee]] and ogan go directly to [[Ogan and Lizee's Home]]. [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] and [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] go to their [[Sherry and Serin's Apartment]]. 

### Lizee and Ogan:
- batches of alcohol: 81, 80
- racoons bottle all of the alcohol and forest creatures
- ogan is asleep while watching the creatures do their stuff
- [[Luzo]] is still mostly walking, and they share what they had been doing

### Serin:
- wisdom saving throw as he is asleep:
	- serin passes out while doing work
	- jerked back up: sitting down no desk, just darkness
		- stand up, look at the ring: dark discoloration has spread to up to almost his shoulder, not painful but tingling/bubbling
		- dancing lights: the full arm goes numb as he does it, the light does jack shit
		- hears faint whispers sounding like they are coming from inside his ears
		- it grows louder once they are there
		- when he tries to focus on one he feels a sharp pain in his head
		- then they suddenly stop
			- Arm is violently spasming
			- ring is pitch black on his hand, once touched it hurts but he can't pull his hand away, his other hand starts to darken.
			- the corruption starts to drain down into the ring from both of the hands and arm. it starts dripping
			- take out the tomb
				- markings and languages he doesn't understand but it doesn't make sense
				- whispers start again
			- He sits there
			- something touches his foot
			- under his desk is the slick black color in a pile
				- looks closer it moves and wrigles like a leach
			- he reaches towards it
				- it recoils then slithers away to a corner and squeezes itself in a crack into the floorboards then it is gone
- [[ruby]]: all he is getting is feelings and the idea that he needs to keep it on him


### Sherry goes to his room and knocks out:
- Sherry walks in, seems normal he's doing work
- sherry does not know what it is and does not cast identify

### Nahran: 
- nothing is at the post office for me. 
- As im leaving lathanders i have an odd sensation the noise around me fades out
- [[voice inside my head]] "things have calmed down a little bit, i would like to meet with you and your companions, toinight" + address
	- it is a lot of industry and craftsman's guild, not the pipes. mining warehouses/guild work. not much residence. mostly industrial.
- do i recognize: i have met the individual before they are the [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]]. 
- i go home and long rest

### lizee

lizee delivers the alcohol to [[jean]]. "mountain motherfucker"
lizee goes into the city and runs toward the nearest blacksmith

lizee goes to an [[The tempered flame]] and asks for 200 gold worth of racoon weapons. 
- mini great sword
- several knives/daggers
- metal choice: steel 
the [[fire genasi worker]] says that they could do it, it will take 2 days. (13th Lonin). he is definitely autism with swords
for the bombs he tells him to check out the [[adventuring guild]].


### Serin:
serin is gonna go on a wild goose chase for the pearl and owl feather
Serin is looking for a pearl and tries to find a jeweler in [[the depths]]. Finds an [[old goblinoid]] with frizzled hair sitting on a stool behing the counter. Very cramped shop. looking at a gem the size of its hand. Asks for a pearl not being descriptive of why serin needs it. He puts legs in prosthetic feet to be tall. He tries to look for the pearls. He has a silver and bronze bracelet. a pearl ring and a necklace with giant pearls that are worth 280. He tries to persuade the goblin to take the pearl. He gets the ring with the pearl in it.


### Nahran
nahran: i go to find ogan and i see an woodland creature sweatshop.
i tell him about the [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] and how he wants to meet with us at the address. 
[[437 south rutherford lane]]
he asks to leave in a hour during that i make a special vial of acid

### lizee:
- goes to the [[adventuring guild]]. 
- heavy wooden doors with wrought iron.
- inside is dimmly lit because they are using torches
- towering lizard folk with a silver great sword, elf with a flail and tower shield
- some are tinkering, talking, doing work, kind of like a DMV
- goes to a human man late 40's. 
	- the human asks for an id number 
	- he suggests to lizee to join and gives her paperwork
	- one gold per year to join
- ID number 13861086
- the nearest bomb shop: [[shimbblegrannk's adventuring supplies]]
it is in a more commercial place. Big stone building, nice cut stone bricks, nice flags
- through the ceiling is a skylight, 3 floors, basically a super store
	- finds smoke bombs and cherry bombs
	- 50g worth
out of the 380 assembly members the [[adventuring guild]] has 4 members in [[The Assembly]].

### Serin:
- running home: bring the pearl
- sherry has 12 diagrams of clocks
- what about the owl feather, "i will be right back"
- goes through many neighborhoods, there is a pet shop by the [[conservatorium arcanum]]. 
- he goes to the [[college store]]
- see a little bit of so many different things, he goes up to the counter they sell owls
- they come back after serin hear struggling, he brings out the owl that is unruly ill give you one gold for a feather. only if you can get it.
- he buys it. [[barnabey]] is its name. very small tasmanian devil acting bird.
- he grabs a feather

goes home:
- brings the bird in then hands the feather to him.
- sherry looks at the [[ruby]] before casting
	- wis saving throw
		- hear a voice "you know you should probably let this be, tell your friend that i cant cast the spell"
the place that they live is above the [[baker family restraunt]]

- serin hears a voice in his head "take that" to someone's pouch

### Nahran
I bjorn [[Chongles]] to go to [[437 south rutherford lane]] with everyone. 
Then i tell about [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] to lizee serin and sherry.  [[Armageddon]] is stealthed.

### together again
- serin offers the derranged owl to ogan, he ritually casts speak with animals
	- "are you okay", "who are you" "how goes it" 
	- ogan lets him out of the cage
	- they casts spells on me then they return me, a rental owl. i learned a fun trick: 
		- it regergitates gross liquid acid and it sinks a foot down
	- offers hand to step on and then puts it on his shoulder, very circular and fluffy
- I explain exerything in a very autistic way
- the owl steals the ferret from me

### Get to the warehouse
We go to [[437 south rutherford lane]]
- most of the buildings are warehouses it is not marked but inference
- surrounding it is warehouses stone full of raw goods (leather, metal, etc).
- This one has one metal door and the rest of it is a stone building with a flat wood roof. Utilitarian
- I knock on the door, the door is unlocked, 
- it is dark inside and i use [[cracked driftglobe]]
- it is an empty warehouse stone floors stone walls
- on the back is a garage door
	- big sliding sideways
- the ceiling is bare, flat and wooden

### meeting with constantine
i call out "constantine" "yes"
- i have a few questions for you i prefer we do this amicably, but im prepared to recieve answers regardless
- [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]], earth genasi male brown robes, practical. bald and cracked mesa textured skin, faint dustyness
- "who are you" "looks like you have gone in over your head"
- "perhaps you have head about the [[conservatorium arcanum]], how much do you know about leadership"
- "why has [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] tried to kill you twice" "i dont know who you are and what you've done"
- "normally if someone has done something wrong against the college we go through normal channels, but she has gone off on her own"
- I explain all fo the blood shit and the [[magical red symbol]] on the back of our necks and about killing people and leaving people alive
- youve stumbled into something you dont understand

- [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] was an ambisious and frankly very talented student after leaving and studying on her own she returned to head the college after the disappearnce of previous head master. while respecting her i never saw eye to eye with her, she often expiraented and would, there is a line, she was denied the permission for a expirament and performed them anyways, in my opinion she crossed it. it was disastrous. we were able to cover up most of what happened, but its left its mark on her, her magic greatly reduced, over time she was able to recover. about a year ago her abilities returned much more rapidly. i have had my suspicions, and i know that she has taken care of other people but i have never been able to provve and and i have not been able to confront her about it. most of the falculty is like minded or afraid of her rule. if you have caught her doing something. 
- "what was she stealing" 
- "if she had a good reason i would agree with her" "well you always could confront her and try and find exactly why, i mean, you don't have to, i could just let you go and avoid the college. if you are being hunted it might not be good. if she has not killed you yet she will kill you now."
- "arch mage specializes in living transmutation, she has been running exiraments in secrecy, i asume they are legal at best" 
- "i have has some suspicitions i want to help whomevers on the right side here, the reason i called you here is because i believe there is a chance that is you, now if you have done something bad to her, but if you have uncovered something then i would like to be an ally of sorts if that means, frankly i dont care for her and she is dangerous and should not be leading the university she might resort to more desperate measures unless she is proven to have done something, i cant do much"
- i insight, he could kill me if he wanted to once he says this it clicks, that the person that i saw that teleported away that could be here, it makes sense
- he doesn't have anything on the line so he doesnt have anything to lose. he is trying to get her gone
- he wants her to be removed in disgrace. without that she will keep running these expiraments

- serin question:"all of the stange things have had a connection to blood, are they connected to the transmutation"
	- would she have interest in blood magic
		- usually it is frowned upon and frankly not allowed most places illegal. if it is connected. (hemomancy) then that could be grounds for arrest. it is a dangerous and dark art. 
	- we need a way to tie it to her
	- she would only attack us in a place she feels safe or hidden
	- she would be able to spin it she has powerful allies
	- i cannot reveal my involvment, if you are able to remove or prove guilt of arch mage i would be in your debt. this isnt simple word place, this is an issue of safety
- could we contact you from a distance 
- serin pulls out the [[Book of Shadows]] he signs his name:
	- prove it sherry sign name and then serin makes it disappear
	- [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]]
- lets just say my offensive capabilities are much less cloak and dagger, geomancy. 

all i know is that if she tried before, if you have proof of hemomancy, or if you can find proof. either track magic, tie symbols, those materials would be in her personal study, no one is allowed in. it is behind her office. there is a building on campus that is her office. she maintains a personal library and personal study.
the security is her, it must be protected with runes.
"if you are attempting this endevor if you were to find something in her study that would be not ideal, it would a longs ways until starting a process of removing her" 
"dont underestimate it" whatever preperations are needed do them but i cannot help you once you are there my involvment can never be known
"she will only continue to grow stonger much faster than thought possible" 
her abilities deminished after an expirament years ago
1/2 of the satff of the controrium, she has most of the assembly mebers for the consortum, within the politics she has allies, and others that prefer to remain anonymous. i also know that they will not come to her side with their blade in hand, but they mostly care about their reputation.

### Crims information
is there any possible way this is with the [[Crims]]. i hope not. once you get high in politics you are involved. if she is involved that is worrying. 
the crimson shade assasinate and blackmail/framing and under the table. they are not an army they are affective and powerful with deep connections but they are not slaughterers, they usually do not do this thing, but if they have shifted that is a much larger problem. 
crimson shade is hired, they do their jobs

he leaves and walks through the stone as it melts away/moves like playdough.

### A bit of planning
lizee wants to try to use the racoons to get in. to scout and get directions. 
they might have symbols, theoretcally i am the only "person" without the symbol for sure.
we are going to plan and scout tomorrow. 
plan: ogan becomes spider, lizee does mind see first pov scout out.

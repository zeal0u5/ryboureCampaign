Traversed into [[the depths]] in order to find ingredients for [[archie]] and took a contract for the blazerei mining company. After fleeing green goo, we saw a hole in the wall with a massive cavern and stream as we were contemplating a small dragon with golden light stopped behind Sherry. Chasing after it is a cloaked figure 40 feet away. Standoff moment. 

-   The drake has its back to us.
-   The drake is a youve never seen this thing before, there are dragons that are kin to the species. 
-   It has two hind legs and two wings. Very small. Not a baby, but not full grown yet. 
-   Bioluminescence. Golden color. 
-   There is darkness being created that serin cannot see through. 
-   The man seems to be humanoid, in a cloak/armor. Headwrap. Completely covered.
-   Dragon turns to us, lizee hears, “you guys need to run”
-   Emit blinding light from their mouth, their throat glows and light is shot. 
-   Shimmering wall of light

-   [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] holding eldridge blast
-   [[Lizee]] take out longbow and as soon as the light goes down fire

-   2 more figures come out of the shadows and shoots at the wall of light hits into light and ripples and the bolt breaks on impact and it cracked
-   1st is running up to the wall and hits it partially, cuts through the wall and gets stuck. There is a gash in the wall but it looks nearly gone. 
	- [[three figures from the depths]]
-   [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] asks how do we get down there they respond if you all go at once he can try to help 
-   Drake perches above us 4-5 feet off the ground “whenever you are ready” 
-   The wall dissipates and the wall dissipates 
-   Lizee shoots bow hits 12 damage hits into the side but the are unaffected
-   Sherry goes to the ledge and prepares to jump and hold action to shoot

-   Lizee holding action to jump
-   I dash and use a ki point to use a bonus action to dash and ready to jump
-   The attackers are now 30 feet from us one shoots a crossbow at disadvantage breaks it and pulls out sword tries to shoot at lizee dark substance from arrow with stinging numbness 
-   Another arrow flies over and sticks into the wall next to me and hits the drake in the wing loses height and fights the poison
-   We all get ready to jump and jump off and spotlight shining onto us and we slowly move down stay about 20ft from the floor

-   Mans do be scaling down mountain
-   Ogan gets above the wall and uses fog cloud to obscure us

Out of initiative
-   We make very little sound as we book it away from them
-   Almost like underwater sounds
-   1st leg 5-10 minutes back onto og path, we do not see them behind us but we assume that they are there, before the fork room
-   2nd leg As we are running up sherry 5 pt of damage
-   3rd leg lizee gets disadvantage on ability checks (exhaustion) 
-   Drake is dimming and he seems to be curled up 
-   1-2 hours to get to where we started
-   @ the door 10x10brass ring in ring white and grey swirling w/ runes that have enchantments (long term) it is not coming from this side
-   Sherry tries to go through, shiver body and they are in a different cave 
-   “Guys its just another fucking cave” *crying*
-   As we are in despair we see the opaque portal blink out and the doors are opening the two guard 
-   I hand the drake to serin and casts mask of many faces to make him appear bigger
-   Lizee is distraction with heads and jar of piercer goop drunk
-   We walk through and within [[the depths]] 
-   Find a place to rest suitable tavern get a room
-   Lizee is paying for the rooms and food. Large half-orc burly 2 tusks, 3 gold is put down. Send food up to room
-   Get the food 
-   Ogan medicine check and tries to get information. Attempts to remove the arrow and cure wounds nat 20 and d4 (31 heal) 
-   Ogan grip the arrow with one hand and heals with the other licking around the room. Feel the corruption and the flames spread through the flames and burst with darker red/orange flame and the arrow pulls the [[corruption or poison from Luzo]] out of the veins. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Take a sample. </mark>
-   He is alive and asleep. healed
-   On the other wing, it amplifies the light. The back of the wing (right) patch of duller scales (10-12) 2 that seem to transition from gold to darker 
-   We distill the moon drop water into large grain salt bigger crystals with paler blue light. Fairly large amount
-   Sleep for the night
    
-   Serin is writing in his grimoire since he only needs 4 hours of sleep. The one that he took from home. It opens up all the way itself, it opens to a certain page with symbols. They move and dance around the page, not words but they make sense. Look around, they are not really in the tavern anymore. Casts dancing lights and nothing happens, look down at the ring. Hand is black and darkened. Resounding echoes as they walk on the hardwood and everything seems to be fading into mist. It feels almost lonely, the floor extends as they go. They fall and plunge into darkness and wake up. See the unknownness written itself out in the book. “Feels powerful, feels good.”

I head over to [[conservatorium arcanum]] (mid afternoon)

-   It is in the [[VANGUARD]] wards of the city it has the consortium, the three branches military training etc, militaristic and government run
-   Walking through the gilded strip it all meshes together (architecture) nice lawns and showy
-   People are nicely dresses and actually live there

-   I get instructions down, hall on the right, talk to professor lillia, she will be able to help
-   Sprawling campus of different buildings, massive towers and glass windows. Amazing architecture.
-   I find the hall with more greenery “studies of magical flora” enscroled at the top. Light is being let in and there are big wooden doors with plants inscribed on the doors
-   I push the doors open into a lecture hall and a balcony opens up and it is big with balconies and offices.

WALKING TO HOME (Forest)(not me)
-   [[Luzo]] crawls out once out of the city
-   Thank you’s and let you know all they need to
-   We tell him we were fighting monsters and helping the sick children
-   Awfully noble (lying)
-   He tries to fly but it is very difficult and almost crashes into it
-   Get to the home in the woods, sits under ogan’s tree
	-   The people: "I am a sense of light and he is tasked with bringing light to the darkness I seek to illuminate all that is in darkness physically and metaphorically bring people to light"
	-   Find myself going to [[the depths]] to illuminate them, harsh backlash for the past few months, light up as much as possible. The deeper he went found more trouble
	-   2 weeks ago notices figures following him and hid/run from them until he ran into us
	-   They are cloaked, move in groups, and seem to be hunting him specifically. They are represented or hired by someone who wants [[the depths]] kept in the darkness. 
	-   He does plan on returning to [[the depths]], but in the state he is in he is going to heal and go where it is safe
		-   He is going to stay at the house
    
-   Asks about the marks, he is not sure what it is. 
-   I return now
    
Serin sends letters home, 10 gold for 2 letters in one envelope.

I make a little abode outside

Sherry would find a tree and crash

Serin would be in the shack

The forest seems to be thriving and good about it.

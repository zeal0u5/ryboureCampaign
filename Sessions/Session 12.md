If we want to get to [[VANGUARD]] ([[conservatorium arcanum]]) it would take us 2 hours. 
It is still the 11th of Lonin.
We walk over to find an inn.
The closest inn (where we are staying)  would be in [[Gilded Strip]]. 
[[Ogan the Flame Shell]] is going to turn into a spider, [[Lizee]] is going to see and hear as the spider and go potato. [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] will be using the [[Book of Shadows]] to communicate. [[Nahran Umbra]] goes to the inn. [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] will give temp hp to ogan.

### Hotel
In the room: one bed, nice curtains, someone excorts us to the room. 
From the [[headmaster office]] would be a person's 10 minute walk. 
ogan does the pass without trace then turns into a spider. 
lizee casts beast sense then sherry gives temp hp
I deliver ogan to [[conservatorium arcanum]]. 
They test the book, it is stylized and ogan looks like ogan sounds
we get there within 5 minutes inconspicuously. 

### Ogan's Spy Mission
At the [[conservatorium arcanum]] there is a wrought iron gate, closed around the campus. Ogan goes into the gate

Ogan goes north east ish to get to the [[headmaster office]] it takes him a bit
It has mismatched architecture

#### The Building
- carved wooden releifs in the from similar to elven
- not large less ultilitarian but it is secluded
- it has hedges on three sides
- at the front it curves back in and it has a row of windows on the second floor with a dim glow of light
- heavy wooden doors

#### Inside the building
- dark empty room, a few chairs on the right
- on the left is a sort of receotionist desk
- long room
- two doors behind reception
- on door on the back wall
- one door to the right
	- looks heavier and some carvings
- wooden floors
- walls are cut stone but polished

Ogan goes to the desk,but they have been locked or they are too heavy
goes to the door behind the desk goes to the one on the right
- 20 feet wide and it is long
- a lot of decor, artwork on the wall
- chairs on the side of the wall
- door on the far left corner

##### Exploring further
- sees a very long hallway with polished wooden floors
- at the far end is double doors and halfway down is also double doors
- halway doors:
	- caverenous chamber 1&2 floor. windows panes of light
	- sconces burning on the wall
	- balcony around the side with book shelves
	- center of the room is a desk
	- behind the desk is two statues, but no doors
	- desk:
		- stationary with [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] letter head
		- no details just meetings like a schedule
		- nothing super
- all the way down:
	- hear/feel trembling and heavy impacts of someone walking by
	- inside the room is something walking
	- peak through under the door
		- two figures, dimly lit
		- one is sitting and smoking and another one is pacing and goes to the window (his)
		- says "im not sure about this"
		- the dude in the chair is an older male half elf grey thinning hair nice clothes with worried expression ([[Fontar]])
			- lizee scribbles the face
		- there is a door to the left of chair man and double doors across from him
		- goes to see the other face: he is worried, but hiding it well. elven figure with a crooked nose, dressed finely. Very elvish feature but smoother. odd disposition. weird eloquence. not a figure they have seen before ([[Vrekstan'kenn]])
			- lizee draws it
- gets out and goes through the door
	- this room is less ornate, the door is locked with chains from the inside
	- inside the room there are cabinets, not storage. very locked
	- ogan notes the room and goes back to the room
- goes into the other door in the room
	- similar room to the dudes' room. no window. two doors
	- it feels like a place for people to sit and wait for a meeting
	- not used as much
	- Peak through a door
		- least decorated room
		- two chairs two desks. 
		- big calendar
		- filing cabinets
		- managerial room
		- the next door:
			- leads to the front desk
	- left behind the desk is a closet
- the men: he is pacing again. both men stand up and looking at each other. not saying anything
	- 5 minute watch
	- half elf "uh look i dont agree with all of this what other choice do we have"
	- high elf "its not morals im concerned with, i think we both know. if this doesnt work it is both of our heads."
	- half elf sits back down smokes his pipe "itll work, it'll work"
	- the high elf leaves the room
- he goes all the way down the hallways, then goes through the front door


Back to the shelf room:
- from the bacony there are rows and rows of books, like an office.
- he looks for the personal study within the room. From the top it looks to be bookshelves
- in the far right corner is a small spiral staircase

it has been 40 minutes

Searches for 20 more minutes before going inot the locked room
Lizee's link fades away.
he fell asleep on the chair after 10 minutes

#### Inside the chained room
he shifts back into ogan and will make sound 
looking through cabinets in the locked room
ritually casts detect magic
- no magical objects in the room
- everything is almost tinted with magic
- almost like a ward or abjuration all around 
- no arcane locks

#### Dectect magic 
Tries to get every inch of the building with detect magic: 
- not really magic objects
- everywhere is the tint
- back of the large chamber on one of the bookshelves is a tough of illusion on the back wall
	- the books feel like part of the wall. there is almost like an invisible break. tries to put a leg down and it shifts in like a seam in the wall
	- it goes about an inch in like a rectangle shape
	- he gets out of wildshape and tries the door
	- on the solid area, kindof feel the books and it resists a little like a thick fluid and his hand goes into it further like a door knob
	- the knob does not turn
	- ogan goes on the balcony for a short rest
		- uneventful
- he goes back home it takes 20 minutes to get all the way back

### Back to the Hotel
ogan and i take the floor, lizee, [[Raccoons]] and sherry take the bed, serin on the bed

its gloomy/rainy outside on the 12th of Lonin

Serin contacts [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]]
"after scouting we have new information would you like to meet"
**"id like to keep meetings to a minimum unless this news is urgent i trust your autonomy. remember no one knows I'm involved"**
"we found two men that might be involved in something, you might know him"
**"unless it is integral to uncovering this plot or procuring after, wait until after"**

### Planning:
ogan goes back in to watch/follow people into the rooms
we go in and go into the room and then cast dispell magic

if they are not back we look through it ourself

i could go to the campus and scout out while drawing during the day. 

lizee wants to out the sketches to faces and check on the swords with [[fire genasi worker]] at [[The tempered flame]]. 
lizee gives copies of the mugshots to everyone

ogan poses as an professor and serin and sherry would follow him as students while disguised. 
I pose as a student working on the book

### Lizee research
Lizee gets the mini swords from the armory then goes to the library to comb through books
- Going back 20 years, some articles. None of them seem to match anyone lizee has seen.
- not specifically point out individuals.
- Focuses on [[The Assembly]] now focusing on magic people and afluent people
- [[VANGUARD]] around it is military and government association
	- notably these two serve for [[the three legents]] as the military
		- 1st branch smallest but it is all professional soldiers. they have just returned from the [[kessigs expance]] for catalogueing and mapping and protecting the territory from the wild
		- 2nd more specialized
		- 3rd mostly foot soldier
	- do not find either of the pictures
		- you find a name: [[Fontar]], surname. It is recognizable from a consortium article. They were one of the assembly reps in the past for vanguard. they were voted out then showed up in the temporary commmision [[kessigs campaign and catalogue objective]] in the same cycle of election
			- for the 1st branch of the military. 
			- not super eye catching. there was a bill that tried to help the [[conservatorium arcanum]]
			- he was voted out (they redo it every two years) 2 years ago he was voted out
			- [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] has been here for a while. 6 years ago she became headmaster

### Campus Spy mission
sherry goes to the hatter and gets him a grandpa hat for 6 gold
i go to the [[conservatorium arcanum]] and sit and watch people pass by
sherry turns into some dude that is forgetable
half elf with black hair with foggy eyes

they go over to the shrubs
no one stops them and not getting much attention
watch this students (speak with plants)
"hello plants"
"hello" in a squidward voice
"many elves walk by what time"
"2 am"
"yes there was a figure that left"
"he went that way and directly away from the building"
- the plants are kind of rustling in a way ogan understands
"half elf?"
"a bit later in the night"
"did they enter and exit more than once"
"no"
"when did they enter"
"still light still people here"
[[barnabey]] is on his back

talks to barn. do you recognize these men "no"
would you be illing to watch this door to see if they enter "okay"

- i dont recognize anyine walking by so far

#### Library stealing and research
Sherry is going to pick someone's pocket to get their card:
successful.
They are going to [[conservatorium arcanum library]] serin transofrms into the student
serin is let in and sherry convinces the library person to let them in with ogan

ogan tries to find a nature book, serin wants to find anything on [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] and finds nothing. No published books about her in the library. Asks for help learning about marcine. start to get the feeling you dont know what they asked for then feels an imense pressence

sherry tries to find anything about the guys 
- find something on one of the figures
	- [[The Assembly]] representative for the CMERIG coallition of miscellanoius ethnic and racial identity for groups
	- he is a winter eladrin (elves from the fey wild)
	- [[Vrekstan'kenn]] 

Serin goes into a private section of the library with the pull. Almost like a pinprick pressence
See the [[yellow gilded book]] encountered in [[Session 7]] and he feels like he needs to take it
Serin touches it. vibe: unsure not familiar, feel a deep twinge of hate. it isbehind a locked bookshelf

Serin asks sherry to pick the bookshelf lock
Goes back to the section with the book and sherry fails to pick the lock
tries again: and succeeds
Serin grabs the book puts it in his bag, and then relocks the bar
The wooden door slams behind them and a figure looks over at you
"i really need to go to the bathroom"
they let sherry go to the bathroom
the name on the id is "[[adrion keifier]]" an undercommon name

tribalization of rats in neighborhoods, they can interbreed, but they are distinct. 
sherry and serin find him then leave

they head back main campus barnabey shakes head no
ogan and serin goes to a plant in the direction of the plant the trail goes to the front gate then it leads into the gilded strip

### Back at the Hotel
We all share what we have learned today. 

Lizee puts the two mugshots on the wall with daggers
Lizee gives all of the gifts to [[Havoc]] [[Armageddon]] [[Chongles]] [[Calamity]] and [[Devastation]]. 
very old knomish woman knocks and "room service" lizee says come back at a time
arm: coin pouch and eye patch
chong: [[sp'dooner]] asthetic

We combine information. 
Sherry makes a watch! time and date

### Planning
- we have names
- maybe do another scouting run
- [[barnabey]] has not returned yet
- plan to leave at 11 or when barn returns which ever comes first
- ogan goes first to scout, ogan returns then we get all of the buds to join ogan afterwards
- we long rest first
- serin looks at the [[yellow gilded book]] feels something inside of you to want to wipe it out of existance
	- serin flips through the pages they are all blank
	- serin just sits
- it is now the 13 of lonin at 3 am it is drizzling
- ogan gets a yes from the limb [[polished black stone orb]].
- as we leave we see the small knomish woman going to our room to clean
- we tell her not to clean the room

### At headmaster's office at night
We stealth a little bit sherry is bad at stealthing
we make it to the front gate of [[conservatorium arcanum]]. it is locked. sherry unlocks the gate. 
we wait by the gate
ogan spiders and goes to [[headmaster office]]. no one is in there that ogan sees
we all go in and ogan goes through the locked with chains door
sherry tries to get in a window without way to open from the outside
I unlock the window from the inside and then pull down the window. we get into teh room next to ogan where he is chain shut in.
[[barnabey]] spits acid on the door and it goes through the door eating away at the chains and it is now able to open. 
Sherry tries to pick the cabinet locks and opens a few, they all have files and they are different professors. 


Now we go to find the bookcase. As we enter the room: 
- the door slams behind us in the room with bookcases
- we see in the center of the room the desk. As the door slams we are obscured the torch is bright now in the room now sitting on the desk is [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] and we see two figures on the bacony.

### minus and guards 
Sherry feels the alarm go off
we get halfway there and bust through the door
we see [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] and two armored individuals flanking him. 
the two guards come to take her body and is agressive towards us
"itll be easier if you cooperate then we will get this all sorted out"
as the body is carried out minus gives us a wink
Minus walks up to ogan "do you have proof"
we tell him about the illusion door and the two people

#### Personal Study time
the illusion fades, rattles the door handle, the door turns into cracks like cacification, and disipates away
steps into the room ushers a guard to join
the room:
- [[personal study and basement]]
- minus closes then opens flash with bright orange energy
- he belines for a wall then tears books away and reveals a lever, pulls it
- stone of the floor moves and there is a spiral staircase down we follow down
- we see sinister looking expiraments 
	- lots of blood
	- two corpses drained of blood
	- diagrams and texts
	- this is not above board not sanctioned
	- "is this evidence enough for you"
	- i go through the desk
		- sherry lockpicks
		- desk opens 
			- misc papers, two peoces of correspondence
				- one sent to her: no return address or who it is sent by
				- other one: [[Letter 3 from Myth]] with my name from [[Mythdran Cauldic]]
					- i pocket both of them
- minus gathers us together: 
	- "listen i am in your debt, and i appreciate what youve done putting yourselves at risk and bringing the truth to light, but if she was not the only one involved with the conspiracy, listen the way these things work is that she has been incriminated, if you start revealing names to the authorities, they wont get caught but you are. she has been dealt with and will face a just punishment for what she has done, but bring anymore and i am afraid they will put a target on your back"

"does that mean we are unbanned from the library"
"i mean yeah, just don't steal more books"
"also i would prefer to not have an open line of communication with you anymore"
"well i am in your debt"

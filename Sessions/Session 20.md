### from [[Session 19]]
- `i go back to the table and then there is a hlafling there with leathers and nice clothes, head is fully bald and there is different marking of some tribal sort`
	- `he goes "ah good, the 5 of you showed impressive skill, caught the eye of my employer, the 5 of you will have 1 day to report to them and then spides it on the table and he walks away"`
	- `address: in the [[traskbar]] district a lot of mining and warehouses there`

### Starting the session

20th Dra'in 

going to [[traskbar]] from the invitation at the [[the gruzzled gullet]] after the [[full moon festival of kyre]]. 

### going to the building

Going to the part of traskbar with the more intricut masonry after the industrialized portion of the neighborhood

There is a wrought iron gate in front that is unlocked, we enter and it feels eerie almost as if we are intruding
- two dark oak doors with a big brass knocker
- ogan knocks on the door
- a series of clicks happens and then it creeps open
- someone looking through and then the door swings all the way open
	- human dressed in nice-ish suit with vest, no jacket, no shoes, and askew glasses
	- invite us into the foyer where all of the other doors aare closed and there is dust through the air, not well lived in
- the door automatically shuts behind us as we walk in
- he says "I have a bit of a problem and you seem like expendable people to deal with it", "how familiar  are you with the mining industries", 
	- mining industries
		- one of the larger ones is [[kenrith mining company]] which he works for
- "you can only mine in one spot for a while and one of the areas is causing a bit of trouble around it"
	- they are a bit anxious 
- "you need to go there and deal with it, most of the people we sent there did not do great"
- sherry asks how much are we getting paid
- he says "legally we are responsible for 16 level, for each level you clear and bring back proof there will be a rate for every level around 50 gold with a bonus if every level is completed that will decrease with time", survival decreases for the amount of time you are in the mines
- he has been tasked with dealing with this and he need it to be done quickly, it is there job and the company is mad, most companies are family run, nepo baby
- this is not casual, this is a substantial amount of money
- the people who have come back had their tongues cut out
- they give us directions to where it is in the mines
	- they go over the the statues and the tome and flips to the back empty pages from a nice book and writes it on the paper, give it to the person there to get that

I get potion they have blonde hair that is floating and glowing skin, potion of heroism
- blue potion that bubles and makes vapor and is intricut vials that are double vials
- after drinking, you gain 10 tempo hit points you, the blessed thing, get a d4 to attack and saving throws (1hr)
- old man named [[marty haversham]] walks in as an old man piking up a perscription that his daughter

### going to the mines (the children yearn for it)

we head down to [[the depths]] on the western edge
- approach a nice carved out tunnel, it looks man made, with a circular gate with a guard in a chair wearing armour that is not put on correctly
- we wake him up and "wHo aRe YoU *ahem* who are you", ogan - "we are her to take care of business"
	- his name is [[pietro trainee]]
- the gates swing open with a sign that says [[kenrith mining company]] condemded, do not come in, with a lot of legal disclaimers

#### going down
there are old tracks not in a state of use, metal peices missing and wood/stone rotted
we have [[cracked driftglobe]] marching order:
- serin
- ogan
- me
- sherry
- morana

it is a cooler atmosphere and quiet cave sounds
ogan talks to a bug and tries to pick an isopod up to take with, his name is [[greep]] and talks and brings with
- he saw someone recently with a weird hairy thing, it didn't walk it kind smelled weird
	- (within 4 days)

- hear faintly a droning noise like a wahwahwahwahwah
	- origin of sound: figure standing towards the wall with a sack against the wall with little bobbles from it and stuff sticking out from the pockets, steriotypical wizard garb
		- dark brown hair, glasses at edge of nose
	- hands on the stone like making the sound 
	- sound does not increase in volume as we get closer
	- (30 feet out)
- ogan introduces self as [[luna]], she is studying the arcane weave
	- "we are here" with familiar (not really, just a cat) named [[marbles]]
		- 24 pound cat
	- they are studying differences in gravity, there have been pockets/variations in the the gravitational force
	- here ill show you
		- she sets marble on the ground and dark purple energy causes the hiar on marbles and then slowly foats 6 feet and starts swimming through the air
		- if we find weird gravity stuff we let her know

as we head down, travel for an hour without any interuptions and then the cave starts to get more natural and keep following main path
- at one of the forks there are very noticable footprints that head down the small paths 
- we ignore the footprints

another hour passes and we reach a carved stone doorway that leads into a chamber carved in it says kenreth mining company

#### level 1
walk down the stairs (30) and then another stone doorway with wooden planks baring the door and one stone blocking, but it is open now

square stone chamber completely empy and baren, on the left wall in the center there is a passageway which we assume is another room

we go to the next room, rectangular shape and the walls jut back at an angle and across the room there is a door and then there is a carved passageway, in the center of the room in the right corner and center behind us there is moss, i inspect the algae in the center

serin and morana look down tunnels, an tenticle tries to slap at me and it conglomerates into an ooze like shape the one in corner does the same

#### level 2
order: ogan, serin, nahran, sherry, morana
feels musty, stone tiles are worn down, all walls are kind of warm to the touch

ogan sees a small scaly creature with a backpack with contraptions on it
it runs away from us and the hallways has collapsed in of itself

ogan tries to pull out a treat and it bites at ogan's hand, morana goes forward in a calming manner sherry convinces them to come out

their deminor changes for a second and then he tennitively looks up and sits down and pulls out a small object, then places it in front of the rabbit, a small crude looking four legged creature made from clockwork start walking in a circle. He seems to be put at ease

a lot of cool traps and crafts in his backpack that he has put together
in fragmented common he says "who" and points at sherry and motions for then to follow we clear away the rubble, my arms are gone and we can squeeze over

we keep going through the tunnels and he goes to a patch of eroded stone futher down the hallway and draws a house shape and points down the cooridoor and draws a big blob and then crosses out his house

we go to fight blob to get his house back. He gives us a crude drawing of the tunnels and how it is caved in. We headthrough taking the main pathand the other rooms have other kobolds in them

Once we get to the last room he stops leading us, we go on to fight. 

we walk in order: ogan, nahran, sherry, morana, serin, we hear some sounds coming from the area and as we enter we see what looks to be a pile of limbs and flesh in the center of the room

initiative:
- sherry: shadow blast the thing with a pink ball of energy and hits it for 8 damage

[[kobold artificer]] goes and stabs the corpse

there are 7 or 8 kobolds that celebrate the death of them we short rest
it has been around its around 5pm

after short rest its 6:15 serin is down three hit dice and regains 1 spell slot
sherry gives kobold a trinket and he gives sherry a blueprint trap for the slug jar thing

#### level 3
go through cave
order: same as last time: ogan, serin, nahran, sherry, morana

it doesn't really feel like the depths since there is no hustle and bustle

as we are walking we hear a low rumble it grows louder in front and behind us, behind us it grows louder as if things are coming down cave

we run and i trip and fall and we see a rock slide,

morana and i get into a hallway serin is okay ogan trips and wildshapes into panther and trips and comes over him then he goes back into ogan and in shell

the rocks settle and it is a lot of rocks. morana keeps going nahran backs away slower, serin and sherry freeze a bit. As ogan starts to move the rock shifts a bit he goes to wall to try to mitigate. Starts to make it through right at end hears behind some chittering and see a blind white cave scorpion that sees ogan. bug fight and ogan drops out of spider form, the rocks kill the scorpion, ogan rolls with the slide and then gets into the hidy hole

we try to find the correct switch back tunnel, we keep going and it is quiet

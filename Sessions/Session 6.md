I check the notice board: 
-   nothing about the horse
-   Job with [[Brar Venhart]] (rep of the [[drigan neighborhood]])
-   A lot of residential and lower class neighborhood
-   Couple of odd jobs, stuff to be moved, work at businesses; everyday things
-   Ominous job: not much info, “JOB, NEED CAPABLE ADVENTURERS, BIG REWARD, ADDRESS”
-   [[Golden grace tavern]]: fairly close, “These has been paranormal activity and anyone who checks it out will be rewarded”
    
Sherry asks for help with their quest to rescue the designs
Lizee pulls down the sketchy job poster 
-   “If you help me with this, I’ll help you with that”
-   “Maybe we can do both”
-   We do sherry’s first
    
As we are walking multiple people check their coin purses

We go to [[orênge]] (2hrs)
[[orênge workshop]]
We enter into the waiting chamber, empty room (6ftx10x9) grates on the ground and another door
Orȇnge: Smaller stature dragonborn, gray scales that get darker, with a lot of belt with a ton of tools and the cool spectacles

-   Prototype stolen by another artificer, [[Ritsko]]
-   Most likely still in their testing chambers, he draws it out, indeterminate number of levels that go down, same room that shifts over and over again as we go down
-   There is an override that is on every floor to get to the room one level down
-   Metal that splits into 3 prongs with a crystal on the inside, creates large amounts of magic energy to short out a circuit.
-   If for any reason you can’t good luck
    
-   Pulls out a giant slate, a room filled with blue light that makes into different images of parts and cross sections the size of a football. Small mechanical device, horn on one side valve on the other, small metal tubes nobs and gears with runes carved on the whole thing with magical energy running through it
-   Get the prototype back
-   Pull out a small metal sphere (size of an orange) red button, if you want to hit something hit this
-   Lizee tries to hit it with the sword, hits with the flat, not hitting a solid object, the energy bows and pops back out, the ball falls, equal and opposite force hits back
-   Racoons tries to hit it fly back
    
Stealthily tries to recon the building and find it (30 min)

[[Ritsko workshop]]
Large building of opalescent grey, without seams on the house, very well crafted. No windows, but it has porthole mouths. Pipes go in and out the building. 2 stories but a domed roof on the 3rd story. Does not fit with any architecture, corners are curved, and the door is curved. 
-   Not many people around, other people are minding their own business, don’t notice and *thing* watching us
-   Racoons look at the building, similar on all sides, curves into the wall behind it
-   Only entrance seems to be the front door 
-   Pipes are about 1.5 ft dia. On the outside
-   Pipe nearest to Lizee is grimy, but not hot to the touch, no sound from it, sounds hollow
-   The plan: sherry distracts, we teleport in behind the mans then get inside
    

B4, racoon takes you to the door (30 minutes), stone door inlay. Slight crack on all four edges, tight fit
-   Massive room similar to the holding waiting room of the other place, front wall curves, 2 doors both are nicer wooden doors. Walls on the inside are a metal and wood combo. Metal braced with wood. 
-   Walk up to the left door, tries to squeeze under, see stairs up.
-   Right door, room going back, similar to a workshop, figure far away 
-   Ogan hugs a wall and sees a massive lab, pipes continue but in a different style, in the back there is an ending of clutter and the material changes to a dark wrought metal and that goes back into the stone for another 200ft. Back from there there is a large rectangular room that goes back deep
-   Figure is standing at the end of the tunnel
-   The doors in the room, very close to the figure, seem to have a visor, like a welding mask, long auburn hair in a bun. 
-   Left there are double doors, he goes through. 
-   blue/white stale cubed room, tiled floor, wall, and ceiling. ½ through is a shimmering wall of energy and force, very similar to the testing chamber described. 
-   3-4 feet up Up to the left is like a fuse box enclosed
-   Gets back no problem, figure is tinkering with something
    

Execute plan!
Lizee knocks on the door, and after 30 seconds the door shifts back 2 inches and goes straight down. 
-   Sherry and Lizee get inside, a voice from around, “who are you” “im sherry, make small boat big? This is my friend for emotional support”
-   “Do you have a bathroom that i can use?” no
-   Racoon opens the jar and pours the alcohol out
-   Ogan serin and i walk in
-   Nahran tries to plead to see it iht autism and fails
-   Lizee tries to break the wooden door down with the force field ball and throws it at the door
-   Bounces back at Lizee and bounces outside
-   Lizee hits door with sword and cuts into the wood and cuts through
-   Ogan teleports us in, fire is left behind, loud boom and the door blasts off its hinges, hits sherry
    
INITIATIVE!!
-   [[Ogan the Flame Shell]]: entangle the broski 
-   [[Nahran Umbra]]: figure in front of me covenant in red vines visors over eyes, wearing a jumpsuit with work clothes, a lot of belts and tools, big belt on waste, hands behind their back, unsure about race i ready my action to be if it comes within 5 feet of me i attack it
-   Vines: they have a device in their hand and their body writhes and points at ogan. 10 force damage, concentration check, success
-   [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] moves along the left hand wall and casts armor of agathis on themself
-   Sherry, under a door, gets out, “you stole something, we are here to look for it” , moves forward
-   I use my readied action, more complicated than originally thought, stole and name- grimace I ask them what is happening
-   Before they can answer, the metal balls hit serin, lizee, and sherry and bind them.
-   They dont answer my question
-   [[Lizee (in jail)]]: tries to get it off, fails  
-   Ogan: walks to serin and helps serin ready to help
-   Nahran: hits him with 7 non-lethal damage
-   Vines is going to use a bonus action to flick their hand and the iron ball ball hit me too (restrained) i get binded, reach into pocket gets vial and the spell dissipates, not restrained
-   Serin tries to get out fails
-   [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] talks to the person and they say we’ll stop if we stop
-   Lizee nothing
-   Ogan nothing

Out of initiative

We get pulled into a metal ball basically
“Who the fuck are you”

-   We explain it in a terrible way
-   “If anything he stole it”
-   They had a fight and orange took all of the progress back with him and [[ritsko]] took it back and orange wants it back
-   “If i was smarter I would kill you now, how about this, I don’t need the prototype they can have it”
-   Give us prototype and let us go, in exchange we work off our debt, when i need you are going to do what i say for however long i say it.
-   Hand the thing to ogan
-   Iron bands come off
-   They hit off the armor of agathis with a weapon “you’re right you didn’t try to kill me”
-   We leave and the room we came from is singed 
    

We head back to orange to deliver the prototype
“Couldn’t you have just asked for it back”, “no”
Omg they were roommates and dated

  
We go to get drinks and discuss the new job that was on the wall
New job is fairly close, get there by the fall of the night
Headed through the streets: 

Neighborhood:
-   A lot of alleys, not sketchy but it is a little bit like a maze  
-   Step into a more narrow alleyway leads to a dead end
-   As we turn around we see a [[clarity creepy figure session 6]] standing at the entrance, cloaked in shadow
-   I feel the back of my neck flare up for a second, i see him reach for something, i tell the group
    
INITIATIVE:
-   Weird man: pull a long curved sword and rushes on me and misses (it has a liquid on it, dark) hits me the second time 8 slashing 4 necrotic

-   Sherry: running
-   Man: misses the spell against ogan, pulls out dagger
    

I stabilize him with a medical check, i restain him, and Ogan casts cure wounds heals him 8 hp

He is tied the fuck up, no weapons, no spell slots
	From his boot something flares up, and another wound from his leg 
		I throw the weapons off him

“I will piss on you if you do not talk”, pisses on him
Lizee pours alcohol on his wounds to get him to talk

We search his body: 
-   1 [[vials of blood]]
-   Curved blade sword
-   3 daggers
-   Ring on one of his fingers
-   Elven man, late 30’s human age
-   He is related to the pain in his neck.
    

My [[magical red symbol]] on my neck is gone

He has a lot of scars on him, i see that behind his hair, on his forehead he has a scar in the shape of the rune

Who are you
*spits blood*
Who?
It does not matter either way whether i tell you or not, i die either way
why?
“To kill you”
Who do you serve?
“<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">I serve a glorious purpose. Clarity; clarity will come soon</mark>.” 


We have a connection to someone in the underground with the poison
We find a place to stay

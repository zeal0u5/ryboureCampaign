21st Dra'in
### Going to Level 5 
- send light down the hole, it goes down about 20 feet and then light up the area around it
- looks to be a stone floor
- i jump down the hole and i get to the bottom
	- it is 100 feet long and 50 feet wide
	- on one end there is a big dark iron portcullis
	- there is also a huge silver bowl in the center of the room about 30 in diameter and 20 feet deep and 30 feet away from me
- I try to get ogan down and then it is shell first down and it crashes into me and i take 5 damage
- serin goes down next and falls a bit and 2 damage
- sherry ties a rope and uses it to get down and use the rope, so does morana


### Level 5
- the bowl is flush with the floor and there are shallow channels carved intot he floor that weave into the room and a lot of them seem to go toward the bowl
- and the ceiling over the bowl there is a large hole
- morana looks to the portculis and throws a ball bearing and it hears bounce twice and then nothing
- a lot of the divits into the floor are sloped towards the center and it is slightly gradiented inward
- ball bearing goes into the bowl
- the bowl is smooth, not slick, but the lip would not be able to climb out
- morana pricks her finger and the blood splatters into the bowl and nothing happens
- so far nothing is weird about the walls
- i use a reflective surface to try to see the top of the chute
	- it looks to have bronze circular openings like pipes 3 foot openings
- detect magic is done and notice three things:
	- beneath the bowl in the center there is transmutation magic
	- beyond the portculis a foot past there is dim magic
	- above the portculis there is a little bit of illusion magic
- i put a plant in and then above the portculis and then falls back down
- the circle is a bit more with sherry in it
- morana also goes in picks up plant and ball bearings and puts in pocket

#### trying to get out of bowl and open the portculis
- puts sail boat in the bowl 
- i ready myself to shoot at the portcullis and serin sees the opening and prtcullis
- opens the boat/winds it up and then the boat after a few seconds for speed and grenade pull pin
	- slowly unwinds and starts to grow and then morana and sherry step into it
	- full sail boat and the mast is going into the hole
	- not broken
	- sherry picks up the wind up key 
	- sherry climbs up the hole 
	- was proportionate to the weight
- ogan goes to spider mode and through the portcullis and tries to find the magical raiseed thing and there is something sticking out of the wall
	- goes back into ogan form and pulls the lever
- lever:
	- low groaning and creaking of stress and then a low rushing sound and pours down increadibly fast and onto sherry and knocks her back onto the ship
	- smallify the ship and then sherry is in the water and it is filling up 
	- after 2 minutes the bowl is full and then ogan flips the switch gate is still closed
- everyone except ogan goes up the rope to the other room
- ogan pulls the lever and then after 2 minutes it releases pressure and flops down and the pipes start to grown and the last few drips come out and 
- portculis starts to open and the bowl empties and 


### level 6
- go through the portcullis there is still darkness
- morana walks into the darkness and walks until there is a change in the floor
- serin feels a peck at his ankle and a small jet black bird shows up and everyone looks at it
	- its a crested tit
- it just looks and ogan ritually casts 
- morana keeps going and the crowbar catches on something like a lip going down and drops a ball bearing and then but scoots to the next stair
- i get the bird into the darkness and there is a 2 foot radius that we can see around it
- i move the bird into the darkness and then follow the bird
- ogan rolls animal handling to talk to it and for animal handling and the bird lands on ogans shell 
- we walk
- we get to the stairs going down
- and meet up with morana (sexy)(dusty) gone down 42 stairs now
- keep going down
- the stairs start to feel colder very faintly - like a chill at stair 215 every 15 15 steps it seems to repeat
- i throw the coin down and it does not come back around 
- stairs are 8 feet wide and walls are 7 feet deep
- i was at 183 when noticing
- morana takes rope and gives one end to sherry and walks up the stairs and the rope goes around it is taught and 10 feet of slack not used
- the light from mental comes back around never left the 120 foot range
- ogan talks to the bird and asks it what to do
	- it does not respond
- sherry and morana fell down stairs continuously and take damage
- something to power from the outside would be increadibly powerful. the thing looping is in the loop or 
- i meditate and then kill the "bird" that is a familiar 
- morana and serin can now see four stairs down

### level 7
- wooden door at the bottom of the stairs
- looks like a normal door
- morana pulls the door and it looks to be a storage room with barrels and chests
	- 40 ft and 50 ft deep
- chest 1 nothing in it
- small locked box made of metal and morana wants to pick the lock and does it 
	- i get high ground and the rest wander in
	- in the box there is 
		- small quill in a case and an inkwell to go with it
		- the box morana is standing on and opens mouth and bear chomps onto the leg
	- MIMICS

#### initiative
- nahran gets arms out hits it for 6 to get arms out then 9 use [[mauy boran]] and 6 more 5 more damage as last hit (26 total)
- sherry does not see anything that immediately looks different but they are usually ambush things moves to commotion
- morana is one foot in mouth takes short sword and jabs into mouth and hits for 18 damage foot is stuck in mouf
- mimic vibrates and misses and then uses scimitar to attack and does 15 damage and morana kills it

##### no threat visible anymore
- serin is still checking for exits and does not find it yet
- i run my astral arms around the boxes 

##### threat
- serin is shooting and breaking a lot of stuff and found a mimic and hits it with biden blast and sherry misses and morana climbs up to hit it for 16 damage then disengages and 
-  nahran 16 + 8 + stunned until next turn + 6 hit the box 
- ogan thorn whip the one im at and then it is moved 10 feet and a metal box hits on top of it
- serin biden blast times two and 21 points of force damage
- sherry shoots it for 12 total rip the mimic
- morana tries to make it to the other mimic and stumbles and falls prone and then dashes hits the stunned one and for 20 damage kills it

- i take the quill from morana and it has a name on it in elvish [[Acher Neverrealm pen and inkwell]]

12:30 now in the day time

### Wooden trap door
- latched not locked nothing wrong with it and opens it with a ladder under
- the orb goes down the hole
- the ladder goes down to a large expansive room
- the room is crumbled to one side ambient cave sound 20-30%
- ladder is 40 feet 
- we go down and make it down
- looks to be a natural cave and the room might not have been built well and structural material may not be good
- opposite of cav the walls seem like similar to what we have seen before but when we turn back from the corner, the wall the ladder is on looks to be of different stone
- hear a loud metal thump thump thump thump (footsteps like)
- wall behind the ladder breaks open and out steps from another part of the cave, three individuals (humanoid) 
	- [[GeoHeavyArmorMan1]] 1: heavy armor broad shoulders 6.5 feet tall geometric jagged sections of armor, no embelishment the design is unlike any armor ive seen massive dark black stone great sword with adornments down the blade helmet fully obscured the head, and aura around
	- [[BirdCloakMan2]] 2: thin, looks to be a humanoid face obscured by a cloak surrounded in shadows with a bird on shoulders
	- [[SilcoLookAlikeMan3]] 3: tall human man slick back hair wearing nice fitted similar to what people wear for ceremonies with the vibe of a formal robe like a body suit and he has a face - older (late 50s) pointy beard 
		- "ughhh, so good to finally meet you, a minute of your time for conversation"

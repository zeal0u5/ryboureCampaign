We put the vial in the book

Last 2 rooms: 
- room 1:
	- lined with crates all vials, in this room are empty
	- i take 25 empty vials and 10 full
- stone door room:
	- i carrode the door with [[barnabey]] acid. 
	- i use blasting powder to bread down door
		- there is a huge crack in the center
	- then i use it again
	- the entire room is almost difficult to walk through, both impressive quality and amount of alchemical materials and tools
		- there is a [[small person]] who disappears
	- ogan casts dispell magic and then they reappear and lizee webs them
	- alchemy stuff
		- stuff for synthesizing and high quality and quantity
	- they break free from the web and casts invis, then dispell
	- lizee grapples the figure and then we tie them up

#### Interrogation
- we ask whats going on here in their mind
- we unwrap them
	- their nose/mouth are disfigured in a way for acid burn and they cant talk
- I cast detect thoughts
	- who are you?
		- i see flashes of images small goblin figure growing up then older teen growing up then searing pain then the bandaged look then working on different alchemical processes
	- who do you work for
		- i get images of the people we killed. them shaking hands with dapper, then him checking on progress
	- why are you doing this?
		- i see the street we recognize when they were a teen. they are standing over a body. they look at themselves in the mirror again. then them hiding from the outside world. then them creating the chemicals. 
	- what are you doing with this?
		- creating devices like the rod and then loading it in as desired, feverishly creating something that can counteract the poison. He worked on an antitoxin. which are the vials in the front room
	- festival?
		- papers handed to him by the person, timeline, calendar and map
	- who's the target?
		- different shots of people making fun of them, content people, the streets. 
- As lizee moves into the bedroom, dapper man is gone
- serin tries to track where the man went, the back room had a slight trail
	- it tracks into the grass behind the house
	- loses the trail, going into the alley with the house
	- lizee tries to track as well
		- tracks for a little longer and the individual is good at what they do 
	- detect magic
		- nothing out of the ordinary
- I try to make them more comfortable and put their face mask back on
- serin and sherry go to the [[Church of Erathis]] and they knock on the door
	- older woman frizzy hair, dark skin, yellow eyes. 
	- they ask for elsmore
	- very well, wait for him, he should be here within the hour
- lizee goes to a general store to find a cart. There is a big bald woman with tattoos managing the store. 
	- lizee asks to borrow the cart she gives her 5 gold to take the cart
	- lizee takes the cart and antidote to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] to give to [[Archie]] to distribute
		- ogan turns into an ox to transport the antidote. they transport it all. 
		- i say no to bringing the person outside

Cut to serin
- we reached [[Elsmore]] at the [[Church of Erathis]] to tell him we figured it out.
- we tell him that the antidote is on the way to the distributor
- we explain everything to him
- elsomore gets to the place
	- this is the one you are refering to elsmore says
	- where should we hand him over, [[Hands of the Regent]] or [[Church of Erathis]]?
	- we ask him about the man from [[Session 16]] at the church. we ask him to look into it. he says that that brother has a heritage that would protect him from dieases.
- i tell him about everything
- we go through the alchemy room:
	- there are a lot of base ingredients, staples, high quality gear and supplies.
	- small map folded up with 8 or 9 locations and 2 are crossed off
	- [[ornate goblet]] 
		- goblet of luquid fortune. when a potion is in there the stuff is maximized and the duration is doubled. 
- he pulls something out of his shirt like a necklace that glows
	- he gets people to clean up the stuff I give him 3 vials of the antidote
	- we tell him about [[dapper]] about him being alive
	- we show him the trail as well

- he run inside and comes out and he says it seems to be working and there are teenagers that converge at the front of the store
	- tell them: [[holfer]], to distribute the drugs
	- if they dont do anything then they'll have it coming to them
	- archie says "wow this thing is old, you better put him down soon" to ogan

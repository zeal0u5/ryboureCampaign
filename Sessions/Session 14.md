Mushroom tea with ogan goes bad

 it is the 18th of Lonin Me with Nahran. I am at the [[conservatorium arcanum library]] drawing and doodling [[Mythdran Cauldic]] and he walks in and we say hi. We go to a nearby cafe and talk about all of our nerd stuff. The next lil meet up will be on the 31st of Lonin.
 ogan and lizee deliver the alcohol to [[jean]] and get 3 g and 5 s. 

Morning of 20th of Lonin
We go to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] to tell [[Archie]] about getting the scorpion parts from the cave. Scorpio Drieder
He specifically needs: [[the gloom marsh]]
- south of the city in the [[kessigs expance]] go a little curl north east
- it gets more swampy as it gets more east
- do a U pattern to get there
- not the safest place, but people live there and hunt/farm there
- peat moss is good fot me there
- not much jurisdiction
- 2 days travel
- he needs the poison, goop fropm legs, legs, eyes. Mostly poison from the body
- If you find [[lirien]] he can send you in that direction. He lives in the south side of the swamp

We head to the marsh.
It is definitely becoming fall and the leaves are browning and the magic is starting to wear off. 
Rather uneventful, we pass a few groves and get into a wider more wooded area. 
Day 1: we get all the way south that we need to. The terrain is definitely hike-y. 
We are inbetween two larger hills currently, we go to the top of the hill to wait. There is like one tree that we sitting under, spotted tree cover.

Lizee starts telling a scary story. All of the racoons stop suddenly, they vomit. The tree grows spikes and the grass grows sharp. The tree speaks and says well that wasn't very nice to say about my shadow. As lizee continues, the tree puts hands on hips and "dont ignore me". I notice something is off. Nahran knows something is off and there is something wrong with lizee.
We all rest for the night the watches are mostly uneventful. Serin's watch is confident that it is safe. 

Waking up: 
I give lizee and alchemist mercy and we head out for the marsh again. 
We head on our way. by mid day we can get close to the marsh. 
Ogan and lizee notice that upahead at the bottom of one of the hill a few hundred feet from us, some sort of larger animal lying down

As we are walking we get 80 feet from him. He is a sizable mouse deer. It is on its side with its back facing us.
- its 4-5 feet wide. 
- we see 3 heads pop out
	- lizard like with tufts of feathers larger than us, powerful jaws and legs. 
	- They are very rare and most people don't know about them.
	- they can roam very far
- The moose bear is a corpse
- they are about to charge

### Initiative
- lizee cast web on their turn they do a dex save, concentration thing
- birbs two are stuck and one claws at lizee, The two others spend their action doing that and moe out of the webs
- ogan call lightning hits the left two birbs 
- sherry force balista hits the birb on the left 12 damage
- nahran gets arms out then flanks and i hit the bird in front of me by 14 and then kick it again with 9 damage
- Serin hits the one on the for 15 force damage
- lizee 28 damage and splits it in half then the one on the left does 25 damage and fucking kills it
- birb runs away

### Not innitiative
We search it for parts nope.
Rest of the day is uneventful
Things just start to get darker, by 2 or three oclock the sun goes behind the clouds. The gloom is surrounded by mountains on the west and is in darkness. 
The hills turn flat and slowly the elevation lowers
More distictive smells starting
not really distict people places
We try to look for people, ogan smells a coal burning fire
He head due east toward the smell
In the next few hundred feet there is a house with a fire and built partially into the stone and it is stilted into the swamp. 

We head over there
There is a small rocking chair on the front porch
A slit opens and two yellow eyes
We explain ourselves and he tell us to go inside as he unlocks like 5-6 locks
[[lirien]] is a small rather old goblinoid
We all file in
- There is a giant fireplace with massive flames with thin metal cages for campfire cooking.
- Something is drying in it
- "you sure, you are not the first to come across this"
- Their name is a  [[velsh baln]] they reside in [[the skittering grotto]]. 
- It is just north of [[the sludge pits]] 
	- once you are there you need to avoid the sludge, stick to the walk ways
	- i can draw you a map, on leather with charcoal
- we head off now

We get to the [[the sludge pits]] by there is a low lying mist that smells of rotten eggs and large pockets of sludge. There are almost sludge lakes ponds and pits. There is a semi translucent liquid on top. 
It took us an hour to get there, it is getting into evening. 
There is almost a small creek or stream and a small children's boat caught in the sludge
We continue on the path. In the boat there are three skeleton rodents. They are moving and adjusting their course. Two oars pop out of the side and then out of sight.
We stick to the left side. 
It is like 5-8 feet wide, it seems like an embankment.

We come across a figure with a long handled tool bent over. 
There is a human man with a long wooden handle with a rake on the end and he is flippling moss into a pile and harvesting it. 
- "oh tally ho"
- "do you know how to get to [[the skittering grotto]]"
- idk I just farm the peat, any path there is equally nasty
- a lot of people disappear in this swamp
	- [[shane twillin]]
- "well follow me to buy some moss"
	- follow down to his home/shack with sizable picket fence on the front and there are big piles of algae and giant mounds
	- he's climbing and he spilled something. He comes back out with a pouch about the size I asked for
	- It is one gold worth
- "maybe explore the old tower" it is towards the skittering grotto

We head on the most direct path and we would need to wade through the mud to get to the other side so we track back and then go on a different path. we see the same homestead as we pass by and then we hear a loud wing sound and roar sound. Ogan has an idea of what it is and we hear a scream.
We walk towards the scream. and we see the area like the homestead ground: raised rocky/sandy mud. 3 figures: humanoid with armor face down on the ground. man with longbow clutching leg. then a large lion like beast with spike tail and leathery wings. The fur kind of sprouts spikes and barbs. Warped humainoid face with rows of teeth and dark wrinkled skin. It has a few arrows in it but looks to be extremely healthy.

### initiative
- lionesk: hits ogan with a spike misses lizee and I. it starts to fly up, one wing is injured so it starts to run towards the other two people there before. 
- Lizee zephir strike and powerattack 14 hits. 28 damage. She puts a heavy slash to the wing. and hits again 15 damage
-  ogan misses the first ray, hits for 7 fire, 2 damage
- nahran i hit with rope dart and hit for 7 damage. dead

The man laying down: there are many dents and spike on his lower leg. Clean the boy up. Ogan heals him and the spikes kind of get ejected before the wounds close up. They cough up bloody mud and come to. 

shot in leg girl = [[ceelia daughter of the wilds]]

they were hunting the beast and tracked it to here and injured its wing and then it ambushed them
they are very injured and a little stuck. We planned to leave before nightfall. 

laying down person is a humanoid wearing heavy armor with a long sword "I cant thank you enough" 


Lizee goes ahead for about an hour and then the first two floors are fine then it's crumbled in. It is half sinking down. In front there is large peices of stone from above. 
- sitting in front is a figure with a campfire
- if you are here you are here for a reason
- Lizee approaches the man with campfire and then calls out
	- figure stands up, long brown hair that is tied up with a braid and heavy plate armor. Large blade. look to be humanoid with light/pale skin. 
	- "hello" "oh hello" "hi" "what brings you to this corner of hell" 
	- im glad to tell you why I am here, I am serving a glorious glorious cause. I lived as a knight and a gentleman my name is [[arndor goldenvow]]."
	- they stand up and are injured insight and they are insufferably genuine
	- they shake hands they are hunting evil, there is a coven of hags and evil witches that feed on the siffering of others. They are hunting them down and rid the area of there dark machinations. He was able to kill one and then was sent out. 
	- "i shall soldier on with my purpose and my goal, to rid the work of this"

laying down person is a humanoid wearing heavy armor with a long sword "I cant thank you enough" i owe you my life my name is [[grimsk]]. 

The lion thing can regrow the spikes and with a precise enough extraction that can be removed.
Ogan pulls out a small knife and successfully cuts out the part. It is a weird organic small brown sinu lump with a half formed spike. 

Lizee is back now
We decide to go back to the tower and It takes us 2 hours to get there. (10pm now)
He has almost wind blown hair. 
he wants to charge in head 
I detect thoughts with the tower there are two sources of metal facilities within
I detect his thoughts: recounting gimpses with the hags and him with giant sword poking at one and spearing and then launched out of the second floor I go deeper into his mind. I met him and he is defineitly zealous. He believes every word that he says. 
They like to come together and feed on the suffering of those around them. 

[[arndor goldenvow]] rushes in I am behind him. 
Water is filling up the back half. In the front is various things like shelves with some empty bottles. I see three cots off to the side. Ceiling is 10 feet up. 
GIldenbitch goes to the ladder and climbs up. ORDER: GILDEN ME LIZEE OGAN SERIN SHERRY
In the new room: there are things drying, a burbling couldrin, bookshelves. They are sitting at the couldran.

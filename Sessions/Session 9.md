We are headed on after a short rest, it is currently mid afternoon/evening in the [[]]
We havent really seen anyone else on the road
The path is not very wide, not big enough for a carriage or cart

Walk for another few hours, gets into more rocky terrain, before it was more hilly/sandy. The rest of the trip will be more hiking and climbing

As we walk, over the crest is a small caravan, they have 2 carts, they are aways away. They are going towards the city. A few people walking and riding, drawn by a sort of animal. Getting though the mountains is hard and it is a little weird for them to have a wheel carriage. 

They are almost unpacking and erecting two posts as they see us. the carts are connected to large mountain goats (8 ft tall), there is no back half. They have been set up around like store fronts and chairs. around the path. I see no threat. They are mostly just chilling.

As we get close:
*  Dwarf long beard, odd rounded hat, standing on a crate "hail and well met fellow travelers, and what brings you upon us on this fine day"
*  "just passing throuhg" "would you be in the market for any wares?"
*  the crates open up into display cases
	* stuff, clothes that are akin to costumes, small pile of books, polished wooden box, bolt of fabric, drinks, instruments.
	*  Weapons: flail hanging on the diplay case, handle is regular, the flail is absolutely massive. 
	*  I ask about the books, we have our own specializations
* They go to their preassigned spots and break into song
	* Names: [[Draulonus]], [[Big ricky]], [[lil' ricky]], the [[geezer]], Anthalora, [[Ricky]]
		* [[Anthalora]] tall half giant woman, long hair braided and shaved on one side, she put in the least effort in the song/dance
		* [[Big ricky]], gnome looks a little scruffy, out of breath, 
		* Ancient looking man [[Geezer]], with storybook wizard robes and pointy hat
		* [[Draulonus]] is a half elf for the polished wooden box
		* [[lil' ricky]] is a halfling
* They are the [[Mooncrest traveling Curio stand and entertainment venue]]
*  Lizee is closest to Anthalora, needs to ask [[big ricky]]
	* flail is from the fire realm from a fire knight person
	* Can swing it, but it is off balance because they replaced the handle with a normal one
*  i ask about the books, "I am not trained in magic but i think these books look magical, I am a big fan"
* I try to read the books, they are not in popular languages, one book in orc, tribal manuscript of shammanry from the wanderers of the northern plane a deeply spiritualistic tribe of orc kin. 
	* actually not that, tanned leather bounding, collection of paper, different writing styles and papers
		* treating metals, page of a cookbook, 12 pgs of someones diary, just stuff
	* One druid book, tells the story of everything, the book is about crop planting (beginners guide ot farming)
	* 2 undercommon, documents from a voyage from a 3-4 yr period the other is from transmutation and college esc
	* infernal book, guilded and folded into the page of another book. Infernal contract, names scratched out
*  I will sell you that for 6 gold peices (no)
*  The box has cufflings, and silverware set, polished black stone orb, and pair of stilts that have language or runes carved into them
	* these are stilts made of wood and used by cicuis performers from teh 9th ring, some say runes are a message of good luck others say it is enchanted to stop them from falling off
	* The orb [[polished black stone orb]], is magical divination
	* the huge ping of magic from conjuration magic under one of the carts [[ruby]]
* The costumes seem like stage clothes
* [[Chongles]] is having a battle with a garment, [[Lizee]] knifes the garment off, takes and hangs it back up and notice
* [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] checks the cart and its under a wheel, seems to be run over
* he molds earth to try to get it out, glimmer, [[ricky]] comes over, shows him what is there, dusty ruby is it for sale walks to Anthalora looks legit and cut, no physical marking of runes
* [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] buys both the ruby and the orb with platnum
* [[Ricky]] starts to get worried with the platnum because only important people use it
* [[Nahran Umbra]] walks to be alone and write in his journal (no diary)
* [[Lil' ricky]] plays the mini hurdy gurdy
	* [[Chongles]] is enamoured by it.
	* "[[Sp'dooner]]"
	* [[Chongles]] plays the [[sp'dooner]]
* [[Armageddon]] comes out and pays the man
* Very efficient packing up and they go on their way

We go on our way the night draws closer
Long rest with watches
* I go first and it is pretty uneventful I use the [[cracked driftglobe]] to see winds are whistling
* Ogan is second and the orb can predict with 90% accuracy if the person will have all of their limbs at the same time the next day
* [[Lizee]] is third sends [[Raccoons]] out as well she feels like she is being watched, can't name it but its more of a tenatively unsettling
	* She shoots a flaming arrow at the path to try to see something and it arcs and then disappears
	* Nothing has shifted or changed since the lights
* [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] is fourth and the wind's whistling
* [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] is last has the ruby sees a few trees, mountains, boulders, throuhgout the watch the sun starts to rise and successfully rest

Continue it is now the 8th of Lonin high winds
Lizee goes hunting and and [[chongles]] gives me a lesser bag
Ogan notices something weird about the stone about 20 ft up something carved
* [[carved archway]]
* we walk on
wind starts tot taste salty from the ocean
We hear breaking stone that is coming closer to us
I wedge my rope dart under a rock to steady myself
20ft in front is a massive deer like animal three eyes the antlers are carving through the walls running rabid/feral massive hooves
Stops at the top of the hill as it sees us 80-90 ft up sliding down is a figure elven [[mountain motherfucker]] barefoot perfectly navigating through the terrain and they jump and land 10 ft in front of the deer strike the deer with 2 arrows into its neck
(dex saving throw for the rock)
the deer headbutts and the elven figure touches the stone and a rock jolts out and goes into the deers head el oh el
"i am a protector of this land" elven woman in tunic with leather bracers with dark grey/green cloak under
"if you seek to harm these lands you will meet a similar fate"
She gave the burned arrow back to lizee
I bow like [[Lathanders Light Monestary]] taught and she bows foreign but respectfully "i would stop now if i were you" 
the beast falls off in front of you
She might be a thing that look humanoid that protects (nymph or fey)
* it is a moose deer that is too big, agressive, and an extra eye
* consumed something wrong or was cast that way
* form is not reverting

We reach where we depart the path
Lizee is still leading able to find the place most of the rest of the day. We find a shack very rectangular. Variety of crates. 
We will be able to take them all. One box is magical with slight illusion.
Rest at the shack
Watches go without events
[[Chongles]] gives the lesser bag of food to ogan
Continue on some people have exhaustion.
I leave a thank you and a portait of her. We hear a loud pop and the stone is completely flush and the [[carved archway]] is gone
We get back on the morning of the 10th
Serin looks down on the return trip and feels something in his hand look down and sees corruption all the way up to his elbow.
As he touches the ring he feels searing pain as almost a small shape starts to form and the [[yellow gilded book]] appears.
Enter in through the pipes through [[tiffond]] to return the crates to [[Pernalious]] she answers the door in a covering but short red robe 
*  you can just set them down
* We are given 600 gold in gold peices (120 each)
* If i need you you can come, if else don't

We go see what [[jean]] is doing, he sold some stock, people buy it, not many repeat customers
Brimblehold, Woosey, [[Armageddon]] pulls out a list of names and Lizee gets upset about the names given.
* Woosey is from a dude buying it then passing out after drinking 2 bottles

I give him a picture of himself. 

We talk to [[Archie]] and go to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] and try to meet with [[underground poison man]] outside the depo tonight

I go to [[Lathanders Light Monestary]] to check for letters or things there for me, nothing.

Go back to [[Archie]]'s, hooded figure nods and nods to the side and walks into the alley. We go into the [[The Sewers]]. He goes 10 ft down and dancing lights. Humanoid. 

Ogan gives the [[corruption or poison from Luzo]] and he does not want to be caught up
Certain powerful people in the city will create their own kind of brews and it depends on what you want to do but this is not something youb can just buy, this is a small batch of a specific purpose. I suggest you forget anything that happened with this. Shit runs deep. People who look under the hood often they'll tend to disappear. Probably half of what was made. You want my guess probably [[Crims]] whatever you are fucking with you are dealing with people with money and people who wanted someone dead. 

Based off of him and the information unsure of connection with the [[Crims]]. Whomever made this had a backing. If someone would spend this much time, they won't stop trying to kill it. 

He pockets the vial. And walk away

Serin and I hear a faint noice behind us like a puff of air. With the dark vision there is a grate and then a corner. Assume the sound is beyond the corner. 

Serin Sherry and I leave and Ogan and Lizee stay down for a second. Lizee stealth to check to see what's happening with the orb i gave him. Lizee stays close to the wall and something shifts. As she looks to the side a curved indent in the stone like an arch. Similar to the [[carved archway]] in the mountains.

Lizee pushes it and hears a grinding, and it slides itself in and is in pitch darkness.She feels a pull in the arch. And tries to hold on. with just the fingertips outside the door. Ogan pully is sucked into the door. 

The three of us left go and investigate and I get sucked in. Then sherry and serin jump in with us. 
Ogan and the Lizee wake up and feel warmth coming from behind them. Warmly lit room with shadows and shapes of a fire dancing. Wooden floor boards. Stand up and look around. Ceiling is a pitch black abyss of nothingness. Incedibly out of place door made of light stone and it has an incredibly inlit and copper inlay like a cathedral. Pulled into [[omonous cozy room with darkness]]

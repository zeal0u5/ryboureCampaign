Nahran got 10-15 gold worth of materials during the 10 days

Head into [[the depths]] for the materials (north)
We see towering building shimmering in the midday sun made of metal and stone, get closer: tunnel entrance, well made stone bricks
-   Find ourselves in an area that is dark, perpetual dusk. Houses and people living there, more people of grey skin,

Looking at facerine soft blue green glow
Dark wooden cane tap twice and appear in front of me 

-   Deposit of dragon’s beard, down that way is an hour long walk of a hog's tongue. 
-   He’ll be at the [[conservatorium arcanum]]
-   Head down an hour 
-   I would know hogs tongue and find some, get 1.5 bunches of tongue

Goes further down hears dripping water 
-   Damper cramped areas go into
-   Travel an hour or two, small room pushing out to one side with vines hanging how and a [[dark shadowy figure session 3]] small and unfamiliar does not look threatening
-   Undercommon “and is it I that you seek” “if it is me that you see approach”
-   Small stone, standing, small jagged teeth, one large, cool spine, leathery skin, does not like light NOTHIC, cunning, devious, aggressive, but this one is calm.
-   Turn off light
-   I give the answers people are desperate for 
-   Serin tries to give him the mace, burbling goes around it and it disappears
-   “What is it you seek to know about yourself” to serin
-   Serin lets them into its mind
-   I sense something dark here, something bound to you, look at hands they are corrupted up the arms
-   After the vision the black is gone

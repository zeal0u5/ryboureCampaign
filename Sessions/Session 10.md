[[omonous cozy room with darkness]] from the [[carved archway]] in the [[The Sewers]]. [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Nahran Umbra]], [[Lizee]]. 
## in the [[omonous cozy room with darkness]]
The door is light stone with brass/metal instylings and especially around the handle. The ceiling is just darkness. 

order of entering: ogan, liz, me, sherry/serin.

Room is 20ftX40ft

The door looks to be normal, but i cant see the hinges, nothing that looks magical, a little cold to the touch. 

Sherry pushed the door open. 

## [[Skull Room]]
- on the ground is a stone floor that looks weathered. spec of moss or two
- much larger than current room, there is a light source, but it is 90ft away and the light barely doesn't reah the door. 
	- floating green flame
	- cannot see the end of the room
- Lizee sends the orb forward and it lights it up
	- it has arrow slits but they lead into darkness
	-  Lizee puts one foot into the door, nothing seems to be off about the floor no seemable traps
		- everything is worn to the same level
	- As lizee gets closer to the flame, it is shedding out light 
		- it is on a circular/spherical pale orb. 
	- ogan would follow
sherry is opening the door

Suddenly the door slams and sherry goes into the room as a reaction.
The green orb starts to spin around 180 degrees. It is a [[skull with red eyes]] with green flames.

## [[The fly room]]
Much like the first room, nothing on the floors, no furniture, nothing besides the skull, the ceiling is excactly the same and the same stone door we came through
Sherry casted heal wounds for me

Walk into a new room: Smaller, sweet dripping humidity, no windows, cutouts in the wood, on the other side: door, blocking it is a small wooden bar stool pedestal. on it is a velvet cloth pillow

As i walk up to it there is a small spec on the pillow. There is a small bug it flies around the room. I cannot get to the door. 

Ogan: speak with animals bug:fuck off, geet the fuck out: this is my home, 

The [[fly]] flies around and bites people

Sherry cannons the pedestal and it bounces off
We try everything to move the pedestal. Serin finally kills the fly with Armor of Agathis (Fortified Frost) and then the pedistal falls

## [[Statue Room]]

- Polished stone floor stone statues lining the edge of the room all of them are warriors in different positions. a bit chilly
- Similar door at the end. torches on the wall
- Sherry inspects a closer statue
	- these seem to be holding a lance, they are next to the guards, mostly guarding, ceremonial position they look to be well made and they look very very similar face it featureless
- My mans holding  large warhammer, heavy swinger. i get out of his range and cold to the touch. it is one peice of stone. nothing is recognizable with craftsmanship
- Ogan's two short swords dark granite smooth and polished, not shiny but not rough edges casting detecting magic
- Serin looking at the ones in front of the door. They are wearing armor it looks to be layered armor skirt and chest. They aer blocking the door
- lizee approaches the one with a long sword. 
	- [[Calamity]] walks over to a sword and mimics the pose
	- [[Chongles]], [[Armageddon]], [[Havoc]], [[Devastation]] are looking around
	- the weapons do not look damaged, the sword is a little off, it is very generic. 
	- except for the handles, they are way too thin
- Lizee and i pull down the [[soldier with warhammer]]'s hammer at the same time. Mine is solid stone lizee's hammer slides down and hits lizee 8 damage

### Out of Initiative
ogan senses nothing magical in the room
but there is an ambiant magical conjuration all around the room
- "almost like a room drifting in a sandstorm"

## [[Obelisk Time Room]]

walk into this room:
- this room is a wooden floor. All of the room seem different. polished dark wood
- in the middle emminating a soft glow on the ground there is a brass circle inlay. in the middle there is a stone. obelisk rounded on top, made of stone.
- nothing is weird on the walls or floor. no furniture. Serin slowly approaches
- the weather at our location tomorrow will be "time"
- There are shapes and runes carved into it. enchantment runes, not sure for what
- Strong necrotic energy from it
- This has to do with living things and time/lifespan
- I hit it and bell noise and con save sherry and i have a ringing and it knocks us and then 
- The door does not open
- I see that there are runes all over it. and what i hear: ambient noise besides the party member.
- Ogan sees silvan writing, "the faster time goes, the faster you age the sooner you leave"
- shoots it and one point of exhaustion
- After the  short rest the door opens

## [[History Table Room]]
- smells like mothballs and books
- 60ft wooden table with a big slit down the center. next to is is a plethera of peices of wood that fit into the slit
	- writing is on the wood
- it is on common language
- they are detailing the founding of a city, a name of a war, a disaster, bland political names, 
- Serin knows 52/65 of them 40/65 can be in definite order
- out of the 12 serin are sure 8 are positive 6/13 i know of and when
- ogan heard of the 1/13 so 8 left
- when we put it in they all fit, but they can move around
- we put them in order
- I get two nat 20s and the door opens when we put all of it in

## [[Whore Head Room]]
A horrible sign upon a stone pedistule an austire of reverent chamber is the head of a horrible beast and looks like it has bee strtched beyond the lays of nature, long mane, legs, and badly drawn face 
it is a [[whore head]]
"well it seems you have traversed into my realm"
"i felt a new call and a awakening that i havent felt in a melenium, you have passed through trials and gained expiriance of what it is like to like as i once did and as my brethern and our brethern before us" "but there is much at hand if this is to be your mark, if you wish for my return to this world and it is true in your heart we shall meet again when you are ready more trial will await to truely gain the knowledge of my expiriance go forth brave ones fulfill your noble deedds but do not forget my hideous face and what could be in this lifetime " "yonder you shall find your exit, our paths shall cross again"
beyond the pedistule the door appears it is the same [[carved archway]] that we got into this place from

WE ESCAPE THE [[Interdimensional Whore's Dungeon]]
### other side of the door
we arrive in [[The Sewers]] without any idea how much time has past

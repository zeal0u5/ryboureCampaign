[[Nahran Umbra]], [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], [[Morana Vosnesensky]], [[Session 22]]

### It is the 21st Dra'in at 12:30pm ish
- wall behind the ladder breaks open and out steps from another part of the cave, three individuals (humanoid) 
	- [[GeoHeavyArmorMan1]] 1: overlapping heavy armor broad shoulders 6.5 feet tall geometric jagged sections of armor, dark gun metal, with magical runes on it, the design is unlike any armor ive seen massive dark black stone great sword with adornments down the blade (runes) helmet fully obscured the head, and aura around. Cannot see the face
	- [[BirdCloakMan2]] 2: thin, looks to be a humanoid face obscured by a cloak surrounded in shadows with a bird on shoulders. Little bit of dark smoke around them, not enought to obscure anything
	- [[SilcoLookAlikeMan3]] 3: put together tall human man slick back hair wearing nice fitted similar to what people wear for ceremonies with the vibe of a formal robe like a body suit and he has a face - older (late 50s) pointy beard 
		- "ughhh, so good to finally meet you, a minute of your time for conversation"

"would one of you like to volunteer" - [[SilcoLookAlikeMan3]]
"I would volunteer" ... "they seem like nice young fellas" - ogan

needs a wisdom saving throw
- feel whole body shake for a second before you tense your muscles and nothing seems to happen
- "thats interesting" - Silco
- he wants to have a conversation but wary to approach
- walks up to our group
- sherry talks to him and feels a precense in her mind
	- "seems to be a lot of space in here, maybe a few things missing" 
- looks to morana and feels a pit in the center of your brain and take up more space and it is uncomfortable
- looks to me and I resist from him and I feel a force around the perimiter of my mind just looking, not probing - does not feel like what I normally do 
- serin "what do you want" and gets into his mind 
	- 'my question is what you want with that little book'
- "would you like to come with me"
- "time wont matter where I take you"

"entertaining group, unfortunately my employer was quite strict with the demands you understand"
nahran - "ill go instead"
"maybe ill just pick who is last"

"these people just in general are difficult to deal with "
i cast detect thoughts
i am overcom in my mind like stepping into this figure's mental space was beholding a contraption I dont understand - very hard to probe
the sides of my vision start to blur
overwhelming disgust for "people" like maggots - i am forcefully ejected from his mind 

heavy armor guy steps up to sherry 
- the armor is entirely bespoke to this person
- everything past the mask is just darkness

I have very little idea of what is happening, most people's brains are like a personal space, this feels like it was built/honed to be hostile in its creation

i ask what for

"im bored of this, ugh lets see how you like it" - charisma saving throw - lights flash as i see myself coered in blood they are smaller
i am in a room, the edges of my vision are hazy, there are screams a figure comes in front of me and fire before a blade is shoved through their eye - "a little childhood memories huh"

### After the fight
they teleport away

on the last hit where i took that damage, it was a different caliber that I felt in my brain - he effortlessly broke all the barriers in my brain - he was kind of playing around until the last hit

i get an idea that his power is an eshalan above what i saw today

it feels like a memory the flashback there is no discernable features it is a lot of feelings flooding back

i take first watch i write out my feelings about morana I also write a [[letter to mythdran close to death]] saying that if i die know that i loved him and i am sorry that i died and I give one to serin in the morning for safe keeping 

When I wake morana up i say good fighting and we kind of make up in the non-emotionally available way

morana sits in the ways she did for the flash back and relives the moment over and over again then wakes ogan up

ogan - its the cool day and no limbs lost with 90% accuracy and thinks about the encounter, uneventful

sherry - works on the watch to tinker and study the [[kobold artificer]] trap

[[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] - awakes comfortable staring up at you ceiling at home looks around and everything seems normal and pulls the curtain, outside the room you see darkness expanding and the longer you look into it you start to see shapes form and moves the curtain back and then walks out the room to the rest of the apartment - it is the exact same - he opens the front door and falls forward into the abyss falling down in every direction pulled and mind being stretched - he starts to look around and sees as he falls as he is in the darkness the shapes start to form and for a milisecond he understands and sees it and he is left with the knowledge of seeing and knowing and the incomprehensible complexity of dimensions above how he could even fathom himself scream as his mouth opens from inside his head feels a hand on his shoulder - looks behind and there is you with black eyes coated in black icur dripping, lets out an scream before everything goes dark and he awakes to sherry 

the blackness from his ring is starting to spread, the gem shines with its sheen and feel a mass of some form as it rolls to the finger tip one drip jet black onto the ground goes to dust once it falls

after three hours of a watch - he opens his book and grabs one of the little triangle rocks - they are not anchered within space or time - it has some bearing but you feel as if the way it experiences the material plane is fuzzy could hold potential for something - maybe a hive mind maybe thats what made up its body. he knows its foreign. when holding two there is a slight pull for them to be together. no point in which they snap together

everyone awakes and 

### it is 10:00 pm 21st of dra'in

### Break between 24th of Lonin to the 17th of Dra'in

- Nahran is keeping a schedule the same every single day. 
- I recieve a letter which is an invitation from [[Ryo Enlana]] to go to the [[Lathanders Light Monestary]] in the next few days.
- ryo is sitting facing away from the door as I walk in and i sit down next to him
- "do you feel it as well?" Something feels off, but not sure if it is just because I'm looking for something "The energy is disrupted, shifting, I do not know what this brings for us and for you. if you have seen any evidence of this myself and the monestary would be greatful for a first hand account"
	- his face for the first time does not look in peace, like he is trying to figure something out or see past reality.
- "something feels different I dont know what
- "in time you will" "trust your instincts and your skill, an I feel like these should help"
	- he hands me the wooden case "these have been in our posession for a long while, but they require the right focus, I hope I am not incorrect"
	- its hand wraps that almost look used, wrapped up as if they are around someones wrist. Grey-white color with a dull blue and purple throughout. they are [[mauy boran]]
	- I leave with them
- DATE WITH [[Mythdran Cauldic]] we are going to go to the [[Botanical Gardens]] within the [[Gilded Strip]] but not near the [[conservatorium arcanum]]. 
	- it is transitioning into fall/autumn at this point the hot plants are in magical containers
	- we have a good time and have another date during the break as like domestic adventures
- I resume the schedule

OGAN:
- he has a scarf and old man hat, pumpkin spice latte and goes to the library to read about clouds and stuff once or twice a week.
- one day as ogan is walking away from the library and something catches his attention and one of the trees is tilted, there is a mound of dirt on one side bulging from the ground. As if something was buried or coming up from the ground.
	- not sure what it is, there is almost like a ping in his brain about this thing
	- the ground seems to hum
	- ogan tries to unearth it with his hands
	- pulls out a [[gilded orb, edh]] with a weave of metal that surrounds a crystal in the center
	- the crystal is currently dark
		- "whats your name" "    "
	- as he enters the library and it starts glowing a little bit 
	- as ogan is reading it feels like the book is being tugged to the orb, ogan reads to it
	- as he leaves the library the hum lowers but it is a little more
		- he reads bedtime stories to edh every night


SHERRY
- meet with [[orênge]]. 
- they are glad to see you back, but now they are both trying to figure out the small toy boat grow bigger
- it is a little dificult to fit the mechanics that she wants, for the most part a lot of the stuff has been trial and error, its a bit rough in the begining but it is successful. lasts for 6 hours before it shrinks again.
- the day after this is finished they head to the [[orênge workshop]] and the door is uncharacteristicly bolted and locked shut. It seems weirdly cold.
	- do not see anyone normally around
	- knock -> hollow sound -> nothing answers the door
	- she asks around, they say that the place has been locked up since early this morning and they haven't seen any sight of them. Some say that he entered the town suddenly. He usually lets someone know if he is going to leave. 
		- one helpful person: they saw him last night and he looked a little frazzled but the wrong way


SERIN:
- furnishing the apartment: total cost to move it in and pay for everything is 15 gold
- no mail/response :( from the third letter so he sends another
- things at home are the same and boring, they miss you but understand
- for the first few days the [[ruby]] has been trying to convince him to murder sherry
	- tries to come up with a plan with a devil, not able to find a person who wants it, with a thick enough lead box it can stop being mean, 6 inch thick lead box and put it in a corner of the room. Tells sherry about it
- [[yellow gilded book]] 
	- home alone at the [[Sherry and Serin's Apartment]] one day, pages are still blank, it is dark outside, alone, open it up and for a moment see text flicker on the page and the lights kind of flicker off. and it gets quicker until its a blinding strobe and everything goes dark
		- it is no longer the same book, it is a dark tome with dripping tendrils covering the back with teel and fangs curling up the sides like a clasp, the center to the book is one eye staring at him. Everything else around him is darkness. The eye goes pitch black and then you see a ripple like water in the eye before suddenly a hand shoots out and grabs the side and starts pulling itself out of the void within the book. He tries to close it and his hands wont move. All  he can do is watch. He sees it but does not understand what he sees
			- it is a complexity so beyond his understanding that to be able to grasp the idea of this would be more information that he could p\ossibly learn in his entire lifetime. For a split second he sees a vaster experiance imagine imagining. And then as he looks up he feels a dread take over. before everything snaps back to normal. The dread is not from seeing what you saw its from knowing now you cant understand what that memory was. It is almost blocked. He knows it happened but it is just unthinkable.
			- For a moment, you feel something in your mind, its a shift like you are comfortable now, but you realize you have never been in your entire life. He suddenly becomes very ill. and then he spends the rest of the night throwing up, violently. 


LIZEE:
- lixee shots up in the bed, they are ready to start the day at [[Ogan and Lizee's Home]] in [[kessigs expance]]. gets the sword, nahran is rudely awoken by lizee, 
- outside is a disney pricess sweatshop pulling off weird fruits and making some type of wine or mead. The river is now extremely fast
- and then she beats the shit out of a pelt
- upscaling the liquor production
- every batch is different 
-  She brings it to the gates to [[Ryboure]] and the guards reluctantly let her in weekly.
- This is the last week of the down time, It is the **16th of Dra'in**
- [[jean]] says business is good and profitable. He seems to have taken to it. The new sign and stall is a little nicer and there are a few people who come out of the taven of [[Miechael’s]].
	- the old sailor is [[crenshaw]], the red dragonborne who is an idiot and a bro and chill and fratty is [[jorth]] and the third person is a very small teifling young girl with wire frame glasses and boxy sweater, nerd, she does not drink it, but she is a scholar that is studying it and its properties. "I actually, one of the batches last week, it made my frog familiar actually double in size for a few minutes, this one I use as a base for alchemical compounds which is ten times more potent, how do you make it" 
	- "what are you a fed????!!!"
	- "no no no, ... , um just come to buy more" her name is [[hatoh]]
	- "it is nature's secret"
	- "and this is licenced right?"
	- "yep"
- A tap on the shoulder: courier with red shoulder cloak hands lizee a letter from the [[adventuring guild]] sealed with red stamp
	- "Urgent, there is a very important job that is extremely job that is time sensitive please report to the guild as fast as you can"
	- in three days there will be a full moon celebration for the moon [[Kyre]]. (19th of Dra'in)
	- currently clear skies
	- lizee takes a swig, sour apple. She goes to [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] and tries to get [[Archie]] to try the sour alcohol he tries some, no reaction on his face, "well... thats sour... better than the last one... its not bubbling through the bottle this time" there is now a coroded hole in the floor
		- everyone seems to be sick lately and he needs to cook more medicine up
		- ogan asks "do you have any plans for the moon festival"
		- "Ill probably be cooking through the full thing, if i have time I'll try to find a group to play with, if business subsides by then I'll take you up on that offer."



EVENING OF THE 16th of DRA'IN.
- working at the front desk is an older halfling woman waiting for the workday to end
- lizee shows the notice
- normally people just see the mail and throw it out. "Well this one isn't though us, they wish to remain anonymous" she hands us a notecard with a meeting spot and a time on it
	- reonable amount of time and distance to go to

We go!
- it is a tavern [[The Hustle and Bustle]] lively tavern, music, live, it is in the neighborhoods of [[traskbar]]. 
- we enter and there is no one that stands out
- a lot of people are relaxing, people here are like laborers, lots of different drinks. 
- lizee goes to distribute alcohol
- we notice a figure sitting at the table after discussing common slang with nahran
- the figure: elven man, very plainly dressed, soft features, wearing a hood, not up though, pretty non-descript, [[Elsmore]]. I represent parties that wish to be unknown. Im sure that you are aware that there is a unseasonably high number of individuals under the weather. certain powers found that to be suspicious considering the timing of the full moon festival. My organization has a stake with this festival and we would prefer it goes over smoothly. Get to the bottom of it. We've done research, we are fairly certain this is not your everyday outbreak. Unfortunately there seems to be something more at play. If you are able to uncover what is happening before the full moon festival, you will be rewarded, but if you cannot do it, no reward and the festival might have to be cancelled due to the sick individuals. 
	- he seems invested in it, and not like he is lying, tone of urgency. We have two days to do it. 
	- What organization do you work for - i ask, then detect thoughts
		- my organization is of no concern for what you all need to do, if necessary will make themselves known. He is a representative of the [[Church of Erathis]]. 
	- with your research, do you have any clues?
		- I would go to where the outbreak is most severe
		- it seems to mimic the common symptoms of a cold or fever. most treatments seem to be ineffective. We have had some individuals who are well learned who have examined some individuals they are convinced it is a mutigen that is engineered to be distributed. Few deaths so far, but that could change. 
		- it is now 10:42pm
- At [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] its now 11:30 pm
	- it is pretty dead out right now. not many people out and about. 
	- doors locked
	- we ask questions to archie
		- we've had a lot of people in the cobble roads coming in sick. from gilded strip to the cobble roads. high fever, coughing, whatever. nothing is taken the sickness away. They can't afford strong magic stuff that can make them better. Start in one area then spread out from there. The first case 5-6 days ago, family from [[Lower bralumn]] and then after that early in the morning a family from 6-7 blocks down, then by the afternoon he's been swamped and its getting worse. Whatever is spreading it is starting in one area and spreading from there. The family's name is [[crain family]] and the other one is the [[blanch family]]. The other place would be north of here still in the cobble roads. branch of the church of erathis is coming in a lot as well. 
			- hes making a flu/cold remedy as potent as possible using top shelf ingredients that are normally used with other stuff


Meet at the [[crain family]] house tomorrow morning 17th of Dra'in
- houses are packed together on top of each other. not as nice,
- high population density
- we reach the house, the water is a bit cloudy in the well
	- i get a vial of it
- we ask around for the family
	- they point to a corner house on the second floor
- ogan is detecting poison and disease ritually ouside of the door for 10 minutes
	- see a small boy open the door and he leads us in
	- there are 5 others in the room. one parent 4 children. alll seem to be diseased a a faint aura of poison and so does the vial of water.
	- the father looks up
	- ogan casts lesser restoration on the father and the kids it works!
	- ogan casts detect magic as well there is a faint magic 30 down into the water of convocation and evocation, swims down, hits the bottom, small thing stuck to the side of the well
	- ogan ties a rope to it, there is a part where the rope is hooked on with the rock, we get the thing off the wall and ogan grabs it from the water
		- the thing we pulled out is radiating poison

Go to the next house: [[blanch family]]
- the wells that are not around that one does not have the thing
- the other family: they are at this one house in the rough street, no immediate well in the vicinity. ogan gets interupted by an old woman with a broom
	- she was awoken by a sound and a figure who is dressed in black standing near the well, dips something near it and pulls it back out
	- tells th eold woman that there is poison in the water. 
	- he comes every night, she chases him off with the broom
		- has been happening at least 1 night most 4.

- inside there are pews set up in circles around a dias in the center. there is a skylight that shines light in the center. there is a man in the pew

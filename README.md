# ryboureCampaign
This is a DND 5th Edition homebrew campaign. The main story is within the city limits of Ryboure, a hustling city ready for any innovation or learning. The party consists of a rag tag group of beings that met by chance and now adventure together. They have fought off amorphous blood monsters, thiefs, horses, a floating skull and many more.

TO:

[[Mythdran Cauldic]],

I hope that I am not responding to this correspondence too late. I would love to meet and discuss our separate accomplishments and cognitive insights into our varying fields of knowledge. I plan on researching my various topics in your [[conservatorium arcanum library]] to explore the effects of magical debris and items on potion effects: how long potions last, the strength of the effect on the user, etc.. I plan on studying on the 16th through the 18th of Lonin on the campus if you would care to accompany me. I will always enjoy a study break to grab a bite if that suits your fancy. 

See you soon,
[[Nahran Umbra]]

Dear [[Nahran Umbra]],

It was wonderful to meet you within the caves of [[the depths]]. I got word from botnomancer [[prof lillia vreth]] that you had stopped by! Sorry to miss you but I am delighted that we can start a correspondence. I was researching various types of fungus and how much their growth is accelerated by ambient arcane energy. [[The depths]], as I’m sure you know, give off a potent magical exhaust that seems to have affected the growth of different plants. Curiously, it impacts different species more than others, and so I have been collecting samples to study their content of magical energy and find why certain species are more or less susceptible to this arcane by-product. I hope to see you again soon, and if you ever need to further explore any botanical or arcane subject, you know where to find me. :) 

Sincerely,

[[Mythdran Cauldic]]

P.S. Vreth has been studying a strain of [[Wolfsbane]] bred to have the same effects on spectral canines! I have enclosed a sample.

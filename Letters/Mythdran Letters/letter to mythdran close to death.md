[[Mythdran Cauldic]] [[Nahran Umbra]] [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]

After the fight during [[Session 23]], Nahran wrote two identical letters to Mythdran. They detail a few main points
- nahran is sorry that he is dead
- nahran wants myth to know that in death he loved him and in the afterlife he will continue to love him still
- he wants mythdran to know that the time that they had together was the best in his life

Nahran is keeping a copy of the letter on him and then gave the other one to Serin for safe keeping in his book just in case Nahran dies and Serin lives

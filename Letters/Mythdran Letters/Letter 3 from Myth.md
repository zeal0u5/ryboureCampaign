[[Nahran Umbra]],

I am delighted to hear from you again! That all sounds very exciting, but please make sure you are keeping yourself safe (not that I'm worried about your prowess). My research has centered around this specific query of how to codify the magical effects of these erranrt energies on flora specifically. I would love to meet to maybe share our knowledge and expertise. Let me know when you would like to meet so I have some time to prepare, and maybe you could teach me to make a concotion or two. 

Sincerly, [[Mythdran Cauldic]]

Dear [[Mythdran Cauldic]],

Thank you for the amazing letter and the [[Wolfsbane]] sample! It was so nice to meet botnomancer [[prof lillia vreth]], she seems like an enthralling professor with an exciting discovery. I am not sure what to do with the sample, since it is not my area of expertise, but I will keep it with me, just in case, it proves useful during my adventures. I am excited to hear all about the accelerated growth of various plants and fungi. I wonder if the magnitude of magic exhaust also affects the growth of different species of plants differently. I would love to learn more about it to help increase my knowledge of all things plants! I am currently making potions and collecting alchemy supplies to help my friends and me on all of our adventures. Since we last met, we saved a creature from [[the depths]] from being killed, collected all of the materials that we were looking for within [[the depths]], and fought some interesting fights while exploring. I believe I will visit the [[conservatorium arcanum]] again soon, so try to keep an ear out for me on campus! :)

Sincerely,Â 

[[Nahran Umbra]]

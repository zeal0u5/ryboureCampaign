STATUS: ALIVE BUT LONELY

He was met in [[Session 1]] before and after fighting a giant spider in an outpost in [[The Sewers]]. 

He thanked the group for saving him and asked for music, [[Lizee]] tried, then [[Nahran Umbra]] performed some cool acrobatics and gave him a [[Dirty Silver Medalion]]. 

He also gave us information on [[miranda]], [[Derick]], and [[brad]], and all the goons who have been transporting in the pipes. This may include [[figure with sigil from session 2]]. 
-   Intruders have been disturbing the spider
-   1.5-2 months ago people started coming through the tunnels and brough various things though and come back every few days

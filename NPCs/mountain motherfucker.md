20ft in front is a massive deer like animal three eyes the antlers are carving through the walls running rabid/feral massive hooves
Stops at the top of the hill as it sees us 80-90 ft up sliding down is a figure elven [[mountain motherfucker]] barefoot perfectly navigating through the terrain and they jump and land 10 ft in front of the deer strike the deer with 2 arrows into its neck
(dex saving throw for the rock)

"i am a protector [spirit] of this land" elven woman in tunic with leather bracers with dark grey/green cloak under
"if you seek to harm these lands you will meet a similar fate"
She gave the burned arrow back to [[Lizee]]

STATUS: ALIVE

First seen at the end of [[Session 3]] getting chased by [[three figures from the depths]]. In [[Session 4]] he saved the group from the figures after being shot and infected by [[corruption or poison from Luzo]]. When the poison takes affect he perches onto [[Nahran Umbra]]'s arm. [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] heals and gets the poison out of him. 
-   The drake has its back to us.
-   The drake is a youve never seen this thing before, there are dragons that are kin to the species. 
-   It has two hind legs and two wings. Very small. Not a baby, but not full grown yet. 
-   Bioluminescence. Golden color. 
- He is smart and speaks draconic and common

His goal in life is this:
- The people: "I am a sense of light and he is tasked with bringing light to the darkness I seek to illuminate all that is in darkness physically and metaphorically bring people to light"
-   Find myself going to [[the depths]] to illuminate them, harsh backlash for the past few months, light up as much as possible. The deeper he went found more trouble
-   2 weeks ago notices figures following him and hid/run from them until he ran into us
-   They are cloaked, move in groups, and seem to be hunting him specifically. They are represented or hired by someone who wants [[the depths]] kept in the darkness. 
	-   He does plan on returning to [[the depths]], but in the state he is in he is going to heal and go where it is safe
		-   He is going to stay at the [[Ogan and Lizee's Home]]

BY [[Session 7]] he seems to be very healed and is practicing flying. 

In [[Session 11]] he is mostly walking still.

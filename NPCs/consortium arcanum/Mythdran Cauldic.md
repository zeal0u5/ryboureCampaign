OMG I LOVE HIM!!!
He was first seen in [[Session 3]] in [[the depths]] studying enchantment enhanced flora Looking at facerine soft blue green glow from mushrooms of sorts
Has a Dark wooden cane tap twice and appear in front of me
Elven figure.
He goes to [[conservatorium arcanum]].
He directs the group in the direction of [[Hog’s tongue]] and [[dragon’s beard moss]]
[[Nahran Umbra]] tries to get in contact with him through his [[prof lillia vreth]]. Then he writes a [[Letter 1 from Myth]] about prof, magical flora, and updates. He includes [[Wolfsbane]] (magical) sample in it. 
Nahran sends a letter back [[Letter 2 to Myth]]. ([[Session 5]])

In [[Session 7]] the group tries to find him, but the go to the [[conservatorium arcanum mail room]] instead. 

I love him so much, Nahran and him had an autism moment and now I love him so much.

[[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] intercepted a [[Letter 3 from Myth]] from him to [[Nahran Umbra]] that was found in her [[personal study and basement]] locked in her desk. 

On the 31st of Lonin we went on another date in the [[Botanical Gardens]].  we have a good time and have another date during the break as like domestic adventures. ([[Session 16]])

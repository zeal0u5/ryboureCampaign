STATUS: BOYFRIEND (ALIVE)
<3 <3 <3

OMG I LOVE HIM!!!
He was first seen in [[Session 3]] in [[the depths]] studying enchantment enhanced flora Looking at facerine soft blue green glow from mushrooms of sorts
Has a Dark wooden cane tap twice and appear in front of me
Elven figure.
He goes to [[conservatorium arcanum]].
He directs the group in the direction of [[Hog’s tongue]] and [[dragon’s beard moss]]
[[Nahran Umbra]] tries to get in contact with him through his [[prof lillia vreth]]. Then he writes a [[Letter 1 from Myth]] about prof, magical flora, and updates. He includes [[Wolfsbane]] (magical) sample in it. 
Nahran sends a letter back [[Letter 2 to Myth]]. ([[Session 5]])

In [[Session 7]] the group tries to find him, but the go to the [[conservatorium arcanum mail room]] instead. 

I love him so much, Nahran and him had an autism moment and now I love him so much.

[[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] intercepted a [[Letter 3 from Myth]] from him to [[Nahran Umbra]] that was found in her [[personal study and basement]] locked in her desk. 

On the 31st of Lonin we went on another date in the [[Botanical Gardens]].  we have a good time and have another date during the break as like domestic adventures. ([[Session 16]])

On the 19th of Dra'in, he and nahran hung out at the [[full moon festival of kyre]]. While there nahran kissed him, asked him to be his boyfriend, and gave hime [[pens]]. (Going to a future reader that pulled the cards lust and spark for nahran and him was the best moment) They then went and told the rest of the group about it at the [[the gruzzled gullet]]. He gave advice on how to talk to [[Prow Vestament]].

STATUS: ALIVE

Seen in [[Session 4]] with [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] walking down the road in front of [[conservatorium arcanum]]. He gives direcctions to [[Nahran Umbra]] about [[prof lillia vreth]] 

Someone with simple dark brown and green robes with a wooden wand. He is the dean of natural studies and natural arcanum. earth genasi male brown robes, practical he studies geomancy.

He is the [[voice inside my head]]. 

In [[Session 11]] we meet at [[437 south rutherford lane]] in order to talk about [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] and all of the drama that is happening with that. He convinces the group to try to get proof of her involvment with hemomancy/the [[magical red symbol]] on the back of our necks/the attempted murders. see the end of session 11 for more detailed information. He signed [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]'s [[Book of Shadows]] in order to open a line of communication. He wants to be an ally with us but cannot be involved with it. 

He wants marcine gone because she is not good and she is power hungry. 

"i have has some suspicitions i want to help whomevers on the right side here, the reason i called you here is because i believe there is a chance that is you, now if you have done something bad to her, but if you have uncovered something then i would like to be an ally of sorts if that means, frankly i dont care for her and she is dangerous and should not be leading the university she might resort to more desperate measures unless she is proven to have done something"

He was contacted after finding [[Fontar]] and [[Vrekstan'kenn]]. 
"after scouting we have new information would you like to meet"
**"id like to keep meetings to a minimum unless this news is urgent i trust your autonomy. remember no one knows I'm involved"**
"we found two men that might be involved in something, you might know him"
**"unless it is integral to uncovering this plot or procuring after, wait until after"**

He then appeared in [[personal study and basement]] in the [[headmaster office]] with two guards who dragged [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] out of the room. He says that the stuff we found would be enough. 
he told us "listen i am in your debt, and i appreciate what youve done putting yourselves at risk and bringing the truth to light, but if she was not the only one involved with the conspiracy, listen the way these things work is that she has been incriminated, if you start revealing names to the authorities, they wont get caught but you are. she has been dealt with and will face a just punishment for what she has done, but bring anymore and i am afraid they will put a target on your back"

he is in debt to [[Nahran Umbra]], [[Lizee (in jail)]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]].

his name is no longer in [[Book of Shadows]]

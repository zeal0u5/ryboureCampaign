OMG I LOVE HER!

First met in [[Session 4]]
She is a professor at [[conservatorium arcanum]] and she teaches magical flora. She is one of [[Mythdran Cauldic]]'s professors. [[Nahran Umbra]] talks to her while trying to find Myth and she leaves a note for him. She is a botnomaster. 

She is currently studying a strand of magical [[Wolfsbane]] bred to have the same effects on spectral canines!

Older tiefling woman light ashen grey skin tints of red, horns are curved back down her head, chubbier face. She has a Maternal feel about her. 

[[Nahran Umbra]] talked to her again in [[Session 13]] just cause he was in the area.

STATUS: ALIVE?

First met by [[Nahran Umbra]] in [[Session 4]] on the streets in front of [[conservatorium arcanum]]. 
She was talking to [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] 

she walks by with crimson red with gold trim robes. Figure who has straight dark brown hair that is tied behind their back they have a tome by their side and an ornate staff.  Woman 1 is a high elf, Figure whose skin is rocky muted way earth genasi.Â 
She is very rude to Nahran as if she has better things to do

Next we see her in [[Session 7]] at the [[conservatorium arcanum library]] talking to a gnomish gentleman librarian with a giant foldable map of the library. [[Nahran Umbra]] and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] wait for her to walk off then after talking to the gnome, she appears and guides them to the [[rune database]] 
As far as I know, i cant get a great read, she seems important, i can tell she is not one to be obvious in her emotions 
Im not sure if she can be trusted.

In [[Session 11]], she was talked about. [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] told nahran, serin, [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Lizee]], and [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]] about her. We believe that she is the one tracking us and put the [[magical red symbol]]s on our necks. We also believe that [[clarity creepy figure session 6]] and [[amorphous blood monster]] and [[vials of blood]] were all because of her. She wants us dead. The [[figure with sigil from session 2]] could have been her. 

A few years ago she did an expirament that was not approved and lost a lot of her magical abilities. Before this happened she specialized in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">living transmutation</mark>. About a year ago she started getting her powers back rapidly. She became the headmaster of [[conservatorium arcanum]] after the previous one disappeared. She is staill performing expiramnets which are legal at best and unethical at worst. 

If she wants us dead, she will keep trying until we are dead. She has very poweful allies that include 1/2 of the staff and a few of [[The Assembly]] members. But if she is found out they will cut ties immediately. 

All of her stuff about hemomancy and her expiraments are in her personal study behind [[headmaster office]] in her building on campus. 

We had a big encounter with her in [[Session 12]]. In the [[headmaster office]] in her [[personal study and basement]] it was originally called the canvernous chamber. She had been doing many blood exirements and blood magic for a while. 
the group defeated her and two lackeys that also participated in blood magic. [[minus constantine dean of natural studies and natural arcanum]] and his two guards took her away to be dealt with. 
- we see sinister looking expiraments 
	- lots of blood
	- two corpses drained of blood
	- diagrams and texts
	- this is not above board not sanctioned

She also had two peices of correspondence
- one sent to her: no return address or who it is sent by
-  other one: [[Letter 3 from Myth]] with my name from [[Mythdran Cauldic]]
	- i, [[Nahran Umbra]], pocket both of them

She is [[figure with sigil from session 2]]

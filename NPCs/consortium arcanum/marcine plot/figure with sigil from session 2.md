STATUS: ALIVE

From [[Session 2]].

After fighting [[Derick]], [[miranda]], [[brad]], 2 more guards, a giant spider, and meeting [[Wizard Session 1]], we enter a room after [[Lizee]], [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] break the door down

covered head to toe in armor completely obscured, kneeled down, with large sigil on floor chanting magic spell higher than anything he has done

He has mirror image up and there is a large sigil on ground emanating magic teleportation circle

As soon as [[Nahran Umbra]] hits i knock the last form out but miss the other forms i am sure I hit but as I bring my fist down and they disappear

After meeting htem the [[magical red symbol]] appears on Nahran, Lizee, Serin, and Ogan's neck.

STATUS: DEAD

This man tracked [[Nahran Umbra]] through the [[magical red symbol]] on his neck. The group fought him and then interrogated him. After fighting the symbol was gone. We believe he is connected to the [[amorphous blood monster]], [[figure with sigil from session 2]], [[miranda]], [[brad]], [[Derick]]. 

He has a lot of scars on him, i see that behind his hair, on his forehead he has a scar in the shape of the rune

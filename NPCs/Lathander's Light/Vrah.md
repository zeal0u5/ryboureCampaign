STATUS: ALIVE

**Monastery’s head of the house, Vrah, (She/Her):

-   Not much is known about who she is, both [[Nahran Umbra]] and [[Ryo Enlana]] have never seen her before and only knows her first name. Not necessarily secretive, she is looking out for her own safety since she can be a target for rivals or people that don’t like [[Lathanders Light Monestary]]. 
-   Unknown race and age.
-   She studies arcana and is a [cobalt soul](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Way_of_the_Cobalt_Soul) monk. She has been at the monastery her whole life, since birth, and has now taken the head of house position.
-   Only her 3 advisors, [[Ingrid Muvornur]], [[Theoden Keatris]], and [[Bosar Fokhad]] have seen her in person. 
-   Rumor has it she only takes mercy to get information from people.

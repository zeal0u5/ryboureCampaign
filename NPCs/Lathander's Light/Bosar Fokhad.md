Met in [[Session 5]] sitting off to the side reading a book as [[Nahran Umbra]] is picking up [[Letter 1 from Myth]] and sending [[Letter 2 to Myth]]. 

**Advisor 2, Bosar Fokhad, (He/Him):

-   [Hill Dwarfish](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/dwarf) Monk. Neutral Good. [Way of the Kensei](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk:kensei)
-   Only [[Vrah]] has heard his voice. He is silent at all other times.
-   Always keeps his ax on him along with his smithing tools.
-   He is the “guard” that walks the halls and catacombs of the monastery. He knows the tunnels like the back of his hand since he patrols them in the [[Lathanders Light Monestary]]. 
-   Acts almost like he only sees threats, everything else he ignores and does not engage unless needed.

STATUS: ALIVE

**Advisor 3, Theoden Keatris, (He/They):

-   Chaotic good [Sun Elf](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sun_elf) monk. [Sun Sol](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk:sun-soul). 
-   He trains the younger elves in combat and, if needed, magic. Only does what he is the best in.
-   Almost acts as a high elf. Seems almost surreal. 
-   Elitist in their approach to teaching and when talking to anyone who he thinks is worse than him skill wise.
-   They act as the opinion of the trainees when talking to [[Vrah]].
-   He is the least trusting advisor on the panel of people since he believes he should be the highest advisor, but not the leader of the [[Lathanders Light Monestary]].

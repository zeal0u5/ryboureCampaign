**Mentor, Ryo Enlana, (He/Him):

-   [Dhampir](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/dhampir) Monk, immortal-ish but about 140 at the moment, lost track. 
-   He feeds on dreams and feels ashamed that a parasite lives inside him. He indulges its hunger.
-   [[Nahran Umbra]] does not know this but he takes young mentees because they have the most vivid dreams in his experience. 
-   Because of this Nahran has not had a dream while he was asleep since he was 5 and taken to the monastery. 
-   This monk also trained in [Astral Arms](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk:astral-self) but his energy comes from rage and shame that he bottles up until he needs to show his “true form” which Nahran has never seen.
-   Ryo is secretive about himself and does not share much personal information. When teaching Nahran it was black and white, not grey.
- Studies at [[Lathanders Light Monestary]]
- He gave [[Nahran Umbra]] some special [[mauy boran]] because he felt a disturbance in the force and he thinks that he has the power to use them for good and use them well. 
	- "The energy is disrupted, shifting, I do not know what this brings for us and for you. if you have seen any evidence of this myself and the monestary would be greatful for a first hand account"
	- "trust your instincts and your skill, an I feel like these should help"
	- he hands me the wooden case "these have been in our posession for a long while, but they require the right focus, I hope I am not incorrect"

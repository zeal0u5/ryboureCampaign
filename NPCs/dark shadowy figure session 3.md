Met in [[Session 3]]. He talks to [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]]. Found in a small room in [[the depths]] that is blocked by vines. He did not seem threatening. 

-   Undercommon “and is it I that you seek” “if it is me that you see approach”
-   Small stone, standing, small jagged teeth, one large, cool spine, leathery skin, does not like light <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">NOTHIC</mark>, cunning, devious, aggressive, but this one is calm.
-   Turn off light
-   I give the answers people are desperate for 
-   Serin tries to give him the mace for magical payment, burbling goes around it and it disappears
-   “What is it you seek to know about yourself” to serin
-   Serin lets them into its mind
-   I sense something dark here, something bound to you, look at hands they are corrupted up the arms
-   After the vision the black is gone

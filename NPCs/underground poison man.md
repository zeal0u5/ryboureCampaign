STATUS: ALIVE

This is the man that [[Archie]] can get a word out to about the [[corruption or poison from Luzo]]. We have not met him yet.

Humanoid cloaked figure.

On the night of the 10th of lonin we met with him. He told us he does not want to be caught up
Certain powerful people in the city will create their own kind of brews and it depends on what you want to do but this is not something youb can just buy, this is a small batch of a specific purpose. I suggest you forget anything that happened with this. Shit runs deep. People who look under the hood often they'll tend to disappear. Probably half of what was made. You want my guess probably [[Crims]] whatever you are fucking with you are dealing with people with money and people who wanted someone dead. There is no identification of the [[Luzo]] poison.

Based off of him and the information unsure of connection with the [[Crims]]. Whomever made this had a backing. If someone would spend this much time, they won't stop trying to kill it. 

He pockets the vial. And walk away. [[The Sewers]]

He is a representitive of the [[Church of Erathis]]. elven man, very plainly dressed, soft features, wearing a hood, not up though, pretty non-descript. 


He meets with [[Ogan the Flame Shell]], [[Nahran Umbra]], [[Lizee]], [[Sherrington (Sherry) Farehaven]], and [[Serinus Alder Catiline of Nephrite]] to discuss an "outbreak".
" Im sure that you are aware that there is a unseasonably high number of individuals under the weather. certain powers found that to be suspicious considering the timing of the full moon festival. My organization has a stake with this festival and we would prefer it goes over smoothly. Get to the bottom of it. We've done research, we are fairly certain this is not your everyday outbreak. Unfortunately there seems to be something more at play. If you are able to uncover what is happening before the full moon festival, you will be rewarded, but if you cannot do it, no reward and the festival might have to be cancelled due to the sick individuals. "

He hired us to get to the bottom of it.

We meet him in the church after finding the people that were behind everything, aka [[dapper]]. He gives us the [[stone of communication]].

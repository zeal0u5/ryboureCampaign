STATUS: ALIVE

First met in [[Session 1]] 
he owns [[Archies Alchemy Depo]] an has business for a long time. he is blind, very old, sells a lot of various things, dwarf, very short. A shipment of his was stolen and we were hired to get it back. 

We return the goods to him in [[Session 2]]

We then talked to him in [[session 3]] when asking him about the [[magical red symbol]] on our necks. He does not know. We then do on a journey to get [[Clarified moon drop]], [[dragon’s beard moss]], and [[Hog’s tongue]]. 

In [[Session 4]] We go then come back to him to deliver the stuff. We also ask about the [[corruption or poison from Luzo]] and he doesn't know but he has a poison contact [[underground poison man]] that he can contact. 

In [[Session 7]] he sends out the information to the man. [[Nahran Umbra]] buys ingredients to make acid from his store. 

In [[Session 8]] [[Ogan the Flame Shell]] and [[Lizee]] try to sell him medical grade moonshine, he says he knows someone who might buy some, [[The breaker]].

Archie has given [[Nahran Umbra]] and the others a task of getting some ingredients he needds that are awfully rare, you have to forge for them. in the [[kessigs expance]] it will be south east in the hill area, there are a few caves and burrows and there's a big centaur but if the bottom half was a scorpion (scorpio drider). they are pretty dangerous, but if you get some bits from them. their venom and a few mandables and any other bits and peices. This is in exchange for him talking to the [[underground poison man]].

In [[Session 16]] we all meet with him about the sickness going around the city, specifically [[Lower bralumn]] and the [[Church of Erathis]]. He is trying his best to make as many "cures" as possible. He gives us leads to solve the mystery.

STATUS: ALIVE?

First seen in [[Session 4]] chasing [[Luzo]] in [[the depths]]. They fought and chased the group, while only really targetting [[luzo]]. [[Luzo]]'s theory is that they were hired by someone who does not want [[the depths]] to become brightened. 

They use arrows with [[corruption or poison from Luzo]]. Very strong and does not seem to get affected by damage.

A small faction, with two branches in the band itself, Lathander’s Light maintains a devout, small, and somewhat understated following. Due to close monitoring by [[The Regency]] and [[Church of Erathis]], the more revolutionary aspects of Lathander’s teachings have been curbed and are only taught in more subtle ways. With little involvement in the larger community, Lathander’s Light focuses on preserving their traditions and teachings, and their one assembly member, Adrus Cinber, doesn’t make a habit of drawing the ire of other factions.

### Exterior

Lathander's Light was a square and solid stone building with a tiled roof. Even after it reconstruction in 1369 DR, however, it still retained a number of scorch marks from the fire that destroyed it in 1359 DR

### Interior

Although spartanly appointed, the halls were lit with a rose-red network of _[continual flame](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Continual_flame "Continual flame")_ spells cast by the clergy. Before it burnt down, the temple was known for its bubbling marble fountain that many families used for cooking or drinking water. Beneath the temple lay cellars and the crypts.

 The predominant religious faction by far, the Church of Erathis is headed by members of the [[Reyelli]] family. With 46 members in [[the assembly]], two from each temple, they not only have immense influence amongst religious matters, but actually have the most members from an individual group. They claim to oversee all matters of law and civilization, which gives them a free reign to take a part in most all things happening in the city. Nearly 80% of people within the city subscribe to the ideals or institution of Erathis on various levels. While they are not tied to the government technically, they are the largest force with substantial influence in [[the assembly]] and 5 families. With Eraths’ ideals of law, nearly all of the [[Hands of the Regent]] are followers of the Lawbearer, giving the Church a pseudo-direct control over law enforcement.

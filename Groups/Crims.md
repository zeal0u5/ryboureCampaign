Crims/Crimson Shade is a thieves guild, high profile (organized crime) (not usually petty crime)

The [[underground poison man]] met with the group and inspected [[corruption or poison from Luzo]] and his best guess of culprit is this group. It has to be a big organization with a lot of backing and money to exterminate people. If they are the culprit they are not going to stop until [[Luzo]] is dead and light will not enter [[the depths]]. The poison was fired from [[three figures from the depths]]. 

once you get high in politics you are involved. if she is involved that is worrying. [[Ex-Headmaster Arch Mage Marcine]] might be involved with them. 
the crimson shade assasinate and blackmail/framing and under the table. they are not an army they are affective and powerful with deep connections but they are not slaughterers, they usually do not do this thing, but if they have shifted that is a much larger problem. 
crimson shade is hired, they do their jobs

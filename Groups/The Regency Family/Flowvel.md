The [[Flowvel]] family traces their lineage back to the Feywild. As the heralds of magic and magical education within [[Ryboure]], they head The Conservatorium Arcanum and have worked closely with members of the Ark’Thrun family in the past, although have certain differences about the philosophies of magic and its means of access. Verinus Flowvel, hailing from the feywild, was a powerful archmage and enchanter who laid the first Nexus Web and originally sensed the strong magical energy coming from [[the depths]] to be harnessed. Serving as the 4th regent, they worked to bring a magic education system to the city, but its accessibility has long been a point of contention. Fourth in line for regent is Liliana Flowvel, current head archmage of the [[conservatorium arcanum]]. With a specialization in illusion and enhancement magic and a ruthless ambition, there are rumors that Liliana Flowvel has manipulated the hierarchy and structure of the Conservatorium Arcanum in order to rise to the top. While some are worried about her eventual rise to regent, her passion for bringing magic education to the city and making it nominally more accessible does grant her popularity, especially among more middle class families.

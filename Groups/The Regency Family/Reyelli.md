The [[Reyelli]] are a family of Humans, known as the leaders of the [[Church of Erathis]] and powerful religious figures within the city. They hold many artifacts of the Lawbearer’s champions throughout the centuries, and brought her guidance to the founding of [[Ryboure]]. Eremore Reyelli was a devout follower of the Lawbearer and argued for an official religion at the first meeting of the 5. While this was never codified, the temple of Erathis still holds a firm position as the major religion of the city. Eremore died before his family had a regent serve as the fifth. The Reyelli family still holds it against the other 4 that Eremore was the only founding member to never serve as regent. The current regent is Vren Reyelli, a wise and powerful cleric of the lawbearer. She attributes her 7 years of moderate peace and progress to the guidance and might of Erathis herself, claiming to receive visions and contact from the goddess. However, some speculate how much of a guise the devotion actually is, whether it is true reverence or a way to keep power and station within the city.

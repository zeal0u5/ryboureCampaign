The [[Embergleam]] are a family of High Elves, known for their political leadership and intense societal campaigns for the beautification of the city (mostly just impacting the Gilded Stip). They have a long history of leading [[Ryboure]], with many notable generals, public figures, and business leaders coming from the Embergleam bloodline. Naustia Embergleam brought wealth and strong leadership to a fledgling [[Ryboure]], and served as the first regent. Currently known for their public extravagance, but also widespread economic foothold and philanthropy, it is hard to argue against their lifestyle in the face of the good that they do for the city. Currently, Milo Embergleam, who was recently the commander of the 1st Branch, has returned and is assumed to take up the mantle, as the Embergleam family is next up for [[the Regency]] after the current. Though he has no ambition to become regent, his loyalty and sense of duty keep him on track to do what his family wishes. His younger sister, Mitrias, has spent her life training to be a politician. A masterfully eloquent orator and negotiator, she wants nothing more than [[the regency]], but harbors no ill will for her brother, only their family and its archaic values in her opinion.

Next in line for the [[The Regency]].
